    <h2 id="treatment">Currently no vaccine</h2>
    <p>There is currently no vaccine against or specific treatment for COVID-19. Treatment is supportive and should be tailored to the patient's condition.</p>
	
	
	<p>The <abbr>WHO</abbr> has published <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected">guidance on the clinical management of  severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus infection is  suspected</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>When it becomes available</h3>
      <p>When a vaccine or drug is  developed to prevent or treat COVID-19, we will take appropriate action to  ensure availability.</p>
      <p>Measures include fast-tracking through the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>scientific  review of new drugs or vaccines through a priority review or a notice of  compliance with conditions</li>
        <li>use  of the Extraordinary Use New Drugs pathway for making a promising new drug or  vaccine available in order to secure the health of Canadians during an  emergency</li>
        <li>Canadian  clinical trials for new vaccines, new or repurposed antivirals, or supportive  therapies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other measures include the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Special Access Program for practitioners treating patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed or are  unavailable</li>
        <li>the  importation of a new drug authorized for sale in the U.S., Switzerland or  European Union through the list of drugs for an urgent public health need</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
      
    <section>
      <h3>Special Access to Remdesivir for COVID-19 in Canada</h3>
      <p>Gilead Sciences Canada Inc. and Health Canada’s Special Access Programme (<abbr>SAP</abbr>) are considering requests for Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 on a patient by patient basis. The drug is not available on a future use basis for stockpiling in anticipation of needs. <a href="./en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/special-access/drugs/remdesivir.html">Requests for Remdesivir</a> need to be to be  submitted to both <abbr>SAP</abbr> and Gilead.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="dia">Diagnostic testing and medical devices</h3>
      <p>Tests developed by laboratories for their own use don’t require regulatory approval. Canada's <a href="./en/public-health/programs/national-microbiology-laboratory.html">National Microbiology Laboratory</a> has implemented testing to diagnose COVID-19 from clinical specimens. The laboratory is working in close collaboration with provincial and territorial public health laboratories, which are now able to test for COVID-19. Laboratory testing should be initiated in consultation with the respective Provincial Health Laboratory.</p>
      <p>An Interim Order has been signed to help ensure quicker and more flexible approval of the importation and sale of medical devices that are necessary for Canada’s response to COVID-19, including test kits.</p>
      <p>The following diagnostic tests are now available in Canada: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the Roche Molecular Systems Inc. cobas SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic device; and</li>
        <li>the ThermoFisher Scientific TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An interim order is one of the fastest mechanisms available to the Government of Canada to help make health products available to address larger scale public health emergencies.</p>
      <p>If you wish to submit an application for authorization under the Interim Order please contact the Medical Devices Directorate via email <a href="mailto:hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca">hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca</a> or call 613-324-7842. Health care professionals can obtain COVID-19 diagnostic test kits or supportive devices not yet approved for sale through the <a href="./en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/special-access/medical-devices.html">Medical Devices Special Access Program</a>.</p>
      <p>For general inquiries about the licensing or authorization of medical devices in Canada; you can contact the Medical Devices Directorate at 613-957-7285 or <a href="mailto:mailto:hc.meddevices-instrumentsmed.sc@canada.ca">hc.meddevices-instrumentsmed.sc@canada.ca</a>.</p>
