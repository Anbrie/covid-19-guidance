  <h2 id="h">How Canada is responding to COVID-19</h2>
  <p>For detailed information on Canada’s whole-of-government actions to respond to the outbreak, refer to the <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/canadas-reponse/government-canada-takes-action-covid-19.html">Government of Canada's response to COVID-19</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="ta">Travel advisories</h2>
  <p>The Government of Canada is continually assessing travel risks for Canadians. An official <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories">global travel advisory</a> is in effect: <strong>Avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada</strong> until further notice. In addition, a <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/221">pandemic COVID-19 travel health notice</a> with travel health advice for Canadians has also been issued. </p>
  <p>It may be increasingly difficult to travel in and out of some destinations. If you are currently in a <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices">destination with travel restrictions</a> and your presence there is not essential, you should consider leaving by commercial means while these are still available.</p>
  <h2 id="acb">At Canadian borders</h2>
  <p>As of March 18, 2020, the Government of Canada will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ban foreign nationals from all countries except the United States from entering Canada. This measure does not apply to air crews, travellers arriving in Canada in transit to a third country, Canadian permanent residents, diplomats or immediate family members of Canadian citizens.</li>
    <li>redirect international passenger flight arrivals to four airports:
      <ul>
        <li>Vancouver International Airport</li>
        <li>Toronto-Pearson International Airport</li>
        <li>Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport</li>
        <li>Calgary International Airport</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This measure will not affect domestic flights or flights from the United States, sun destinations such as Mexico and the Caribbean, or St. Pierre-et-Miquelon, which can continue to operate on their regular routes and land at current Canadian destinations. The Government is working closely with the airline industry and airports to avoid unnecessarily disrupting operations and minimize inconveniencing travellers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>implement measures at airports to:
      <ul>
        <li>strengthen screening</li>
        <li>provide stronger and more visible messaging</li>
        <li>strengthen health screening at kiosks</li>
        <li>enhance cleaning and disinfection of high-traffic areas and facilities</li>
        <li>prevent all travellers who present COVID-19 symptoms, regardless of their citizenship, from boarding international flights to Canada. Airlines will conduct a basic health assessment of all air travellers based on guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Self-isolation</h3>
  <p>As of March 16, 2020, all travellers entering Canada are being asked to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/self-monitoring-self-isolation-isolation-for-covid-19.html">self-isolate</a> for 14 days upon entry with <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#exemptions">exceptions</a> for workers who are essential to the movement of goods and people. Individuals should avoid contact with other people for 14 days, while monitoring themselves closely for symptoms. </p>
  <p>For travellers crossing by land, Canada Border Services Agency Border Officers will inform travellers at the border of the self-isolation request and will ask them to acknowledge acceptance of the requirement. </p>
  <p>These travellers will also receive a surgical mask with instructions on use, should they begin to experience symptoms while travelling.</p>
  <p>These measures complement routine traveller screening procedures already in place to detect and respond to the spread of serious infectious diseases into and within Canada.</p>
  <h3 id="when">When showing signs and symptoms of infection</h3>
  <p>In general, when a traveller shows signs of an infectious disease upon arrival in Canada, border services officers, or airport and airline staff contact a <abbr title="Public Health Agency of Canada">PHAC</abbr> quarantine officer.</p>
  <p>The quarantine officer then performs a more detailed assessment. If necessary, the quarantine officer will address the potential public health risk, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ordering the traveller to be transported to hospital to undergo a medical examination</li>
    <li>reporting to the local public health authority</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="sca">Support for Canadians abroad</h2>
  <p>To help Canadians return home or cope with challenges they are facing while travelling, the Government of Canada has created the COVID-19 Emergency Loan Program for Canadians Abroad.</p>
  <p>The Program will provide the option of an emergency loan to Canadians in need of immediate financial assistance to return home or to temporarily cover their life-sustaining needs while they work toward their return.</p>
  <p>Global Affairs Canada is providing 24/7 consular support to Canadians abroad affected by COVID-19 through the Emergency Watch and Response Centre and through consular staff at its network of missions.</p>
  <h2 id="c">Collaboration</h2>
  <p>The <a href="/en/public-health/services/emergency-preparedness/public-health-response-plan-biological-events.html">Federal/Provincial/Territorial Public Health Response Plan for Biological Events</a> has been activated to ensure a coordinated response across Canada.</p>
  <p>A special advisory committee has been established to advise the Deputy Ministers of Health on the coordination, public health policy and technical content related to this outbreak. This committee consists of the members of the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network Council and the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health.</p>
  <p><abbr title="Public Health Agency of Canada">PHAC</abbr> is working closely with partners domestically and around the world, including the World Health Organization (<abbr>WHO</abbr>), to respond to this outbreak.</p>
  <p>Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (<abbr>NML</abbr>) has developed a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (<abbr>rRT-PCR</abbr>) test that can diagnose COVID-19 from clinical specimens. <abbr title="National Microbiology Laboratory">NML</abbr> is working collaboratively with Canadian provincial public health laboratories to ensure there is additional testing capacity in multiple jurisdictions.</p>
  <p>At this time, <abbr title="National Microbiology Laboratory">NML</abbr> also supports the use of other international assays that have been posted publicly.</p>
  <p>Further collaborative scientific studies to investigate the virus are underway.</p>
  <p>The Government of  Canada is working with international regulators to help fast-track clinical  trials and applications for vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests. On March  18th, an international regulators meeting hosted by the International Coalition  of Medicines Regulatory Authorities is being held to discuss the regulatory  requirements for vaccines targeting COVID-19. </p>
  <p>We are also working  closely with international regulatory partners, including the European  Medicines Agency, the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the  Therapeutic Goods Administration, to share information on any signals of global  supply disruptions.</p>
  <h2 id="ct">For clinical trial sponsors</h2>
  <p>Companies and  researchers with drugs, medical devices, or natural health products that may be  effective in treating or diagnosing COVID-19 are encouraged to contact us to  facilitate clinical trials.</p>
  <p><a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/clinical-trials.html">Clinical  trials</a> are studies to find out whether a drug or medical device is safe and  effective for people. We can authorize a clinical trial quickly in urgent situations.</p>
  <p>Please contact us at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>trials  using pharmaceutical drugs: <a href="mailto:OCT_BEC_Enquiries_Enquetes@hc-sc.gc.ca">OCT_BEC_Enquiries_Enquetes@hc-sc.gc.ca</a></li>
    <li>trials  using biologics or radiopharmaceuticals: <a href="mailto:hc.bgtd.ora.sc@canada.ca">hc.bgtd.ora.sc@canada.ca</a></li>

  </ul>
  <h2 id="dm">Drug and medical device  supply monitoring </h2>
  <p>The Government of Canada is actively monitoring the  novel COVID-19 and its impact on the supply of prescription and  over-the-counter drugs, natural health products and medical devices in Canada.  We do this through regular contact with: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>drug, medical device and natural health products manufacturers and importers</li>
    <li> provincial, territorial and international partners</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To date, no manufacturer of prescription drugs or  medical devices has reported any shortage related to COVID-19. We are aware  that there may be supply disruptions related to COVID-19 and are monitoring the  situation closely. </p>
  <p>Companies that market prescription drugs for human  use in Canada must report anticipated or actual drug shortages on <a href="http://www.drugshortagescanada.ca">Drug Shortages Canada</a>. We have  contacted companies to remind them of this requirement. Industry  stakeholder associations have also been asked to notify us of any early signals  of shortages related to COVID-19. Drug and medical device shortage signals can  also be reported by the provinces and territories, healthcare professionals or the public. </p>
  <p>We will continue to use all available tools to help  manage critical national shortages when they happen, and work with partners so  that Canadians have access to the medications they need. Learn more about <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/drug-shortages.html">drug  shortages in Canada</a>.</p>
