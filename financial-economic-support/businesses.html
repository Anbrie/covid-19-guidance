  </ul>
  <h2 id="a1">Support to Businesses</h2>
 
  <p>The Government of Canada is taking immediate, significant and decisive action to support Canadian businesses facing
  financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
  
  <p>On March 13, 2020, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau, Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz, and Superintendent of
  Financial Institutions Jeremy Rudin outlined a coordinated package of measures to support the functioning of markets,
  the resilience of our financial sector, and continued access to financing for Canadian businesses. These actions will
  significantly increase the availability of credit to businesses of all sizes, sustain liquidity in key financial
  markets, and provide flexibility to businesses experiencing hardship.</p>
  
  <p></p>On March 18, 2020 the government and its partners announced further measures to support businesses. These actions are
  part of Canada’s whole-of-government response to COVID-19, and the significant stimulus program developed to stabilize
  Canada’s economy, support businesses and to protect Canadians.</p>
  
  <h2 id="a2">Supporting Canadian Business through the Canada Account</h2>

  <p>The government is changing the Canada Account so that the Minister of Finance would now be able to determine the limit
  of the Canada Account in order to deal with exceptional circumstances. The Canada Account is administered by Export
  Development Canada (EDC) and is used by the government to support exporters when deemed to be in the national interest.
  This will allow the government to provide additional support to Canadian companies through loans, guarantees or
  insurance policies during these challenging times.</p>

  <h2 id="a3">Helping Businesses Keep their Workers</h2>

  <p>To support businesses that are facing revenue losses and to help prevent lay-offs, the government is proposing to
  provide eligible small employers a temporary wage subsidy for a period of three months. The subsidy will be equal to 10%
  of remuneration paid during that period, up to a maximum subsidy of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer.
  Businesses will be able to benefit immediately from this support by reducing their remittances of income tax withheld on
  their employees’ remuneration. Employers benefiting from this measure will include corporations eligible for the small
  business deduction, as well as non-profit organizations and charities.</p>
  
  <h2 id="a4">Flexibility for Businesses Filing Taxes</h2>
  <p>The Canada Revenue Agency will allow all businesses to defer, until after August 31, 2020, the payment of any income tax
  amounts that become owing on or after today and before September 2020. This relief would apply to tax balances due, as
  well as instalments, under Part I of the Income Tax Act. No interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts
  during this period.</p>

  <p>The Canada Revenue Agency will not contact any small or medium (SME) businesses to initiate any post assessment GST/HST
  or Income Tax audits for the next four weeks. For the vast majority of businesses, the Canada Revenue Agency will
  temporarily suspend audit interaction with taxpayers and representatives.</p>

  <p>The Liaison Officer service offers help to owners of small businesses to understand their tax obligations. Traditionally
  available in-person, this service is now available over the phone and will be customizing information during these
  challenging times by ensuring small businesses are aware of any changes such as filing and payment deadlines, proactive
  relief measures, etc.</p>

  <h2 id="a5">Ensuring Businesses Have Access to Credit</h2>
  <p>The Business Credit Availability Program (BCAP) will allow the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and Export
  Development Canada (EDC) to provide more than $10 billion of additional support, largely targeted to small and
  medium-sized businesses. This will be an effective tool for helping viable Canadian businesses remain resilient during
  these very uncertain times. BDC and EDC are cooperating with private sector lenders to coordinate on credit solutions
  for individual businesses, including in sectors such as oil and gas, air transportation and tourism. The near term
  credit available to farmers and the agri-food sector will also be increased through Farm Credit Canada.</p>

  <p>The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) announced it is lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer
  by 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, effective immediately. This action will allow Canada’s large banks to inject $300
  billion of additional lending in to the economy.</p>

  <p>The Bank of Canada also took a series of actions to support the Canadian economy during this period of economic stress,
  enhance the resilience of the Canadian financial system, and help ensure that financial institutions can continue to
  extend credit to both households and businesses. This included cutting the interest rate to 0.75% as a proactive measure
  in light of the negative shocks to Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil
  prices.</p>

  <h2 id="a6">Supporting Financial Market Liquidity</h2>

  <p>As a further proactive and coordinated measure to bolster the financial system and the Canadian economy, the government
  announced on March 16 that it is launching an Insured Mortgage Purchase Program (IMPP). Under this program, the
  government will purchase up to $50 billion of insured mortgage pools through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
  (CMHC). This action will provide long-term stable funding to banks and mortgage lenders, help facilitate continued
  lending to Canadian consumers and businesses, and add liquidity to Canada’s mortgage market. Details of the terms of the
  purchase operations will be provided to lenders by CMHC later this week.</p>

  <p>The IMPP enhances the already substantial set of measures announced on March 13 to support the economy and the financial
  system. CMHC stands ready to further support liquidity and the stability of the financial markets through its mortgage
  funding programs as necessary.</p>

  <p>Further, the Bank of Canada has announced that it will adjust its market liquidity operations to maintain market
  functioning and credit availability during the current period of uncertainty in which conditions are evolving rapidly.</p>

  <p>The Bank of Canada also announced that it will broaden eligible collateral for its term repo facility to include the
  full range of collateral eligible under the Standing Liquidity Facility, with the exception of the non-mortgage loan
  portfolio. This expansion of eligible collateral will provide support to funding conditions for financial institutions
  by providing a backstop to regular private funding.</p>

  <p>The Bank also announced that it stands ready, as a proactive measure, to provide support to the Canada Mortgage Bond
  (CMB) market so that this important funding market continues to function well. This would include, as required,
  purchases of CMBs in the secondary market. Similar to the increase in Government of Canada bond buybacks, this will
  support market liquidity and price discovery.</p>
