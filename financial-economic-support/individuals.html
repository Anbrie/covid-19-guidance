  </ul>
  <h2 id="a1">Temporary income support for workers and parents</h2>
  <p>For Canadians without paid sick leave (or similar workplace accommodation) who are sick,
    quarantined or forced to stay home to care for children, the Government is: </p>
  
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>Waiving the one-week waiting period for those individuals in imposed quarantine that claim
      Employment Insurance (EI) sickness benefits. This temporary measure will be in effect as of March
      15, 2020. </li>
  
    <li>Waiving the requirement to provide a medical certificate to access EI sickness benefits.</li>
  
    <li>Introducing the Emergency Care Benefit providing up to $900 bi-weekly, for up to 15 weeks. This
      flat-payment Benefit would be administered through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and provide
      income support to:
  
      <ul>
  
        <li>Workers, including the self-employed, who are quarantined or sick with COVID-19 but do not
          qualify for EI sickness benefits.</li>
  
        <li>Workers, including the self-employed, who are taking care of a family member who is sick
          with COVID-19, such as an elderly parent, but do not quality for EI sickness benefits. </li>
  
        <li>Parents with children who require care or supervision due to school closures, and are unable
          to earn employment income, irrespective of whether they qualify for EI or not.</li>
  
      </ul>
  
    </li>
  
  </ul>
  
  
  <p>Application for the Benefit will be available in April 2020, and require Canadians to attest that they meet
    the eligibility requirements. They will need to re-attest every two weeks to reconfirm their eligibility.
    Canadians will select one of three channels to apply for the Benefit: </p>
  <ol>
  
    <li>by accessing it on their CRA MyAccount secure portal; </li>
  
    <li>by accessing it from their secure My Service Canada Account; or </li>
  
    <li>by calling a toll free number equipped with an automated application process. </li>
  
  </ol>

  <h2 id="a2">Longer-Term Income Support for Workers</h2>
  <p> For Canadians who lose their jobs or face reduced hours as a result of COVID’s impact, the Government
    is: </p>
  <ul>
  
    <li>Introducing an Emergency Support Benefit delivered through the CRA to provide up to $5.0 billion in
      support to workers who are not eligible for EI and who are facing unemployment. </li>
  
    <li>Implementing the EI Work Sharing Program, which provides EI benefits to workers who agree to reduce
      their normal working hour as a result of developments beyond the control of their employers, by
      extending the eligibility of such agreements to 76 weeks, easing eligibility requirements, and
      streamlining the application process. This was announced by the Prime Minister on March 11, 2020. </li>
  
  </ul>

  <h2 id="a3">Income support for low and modest-income families</h2>
<p>For over 12 million low- and modest-income families, who may require additional help with their finances,
  the Government is proposing to provide a one-time special payment by early May 2020 through the Goods and
  Services Tax credit (GSTC). This will double the maximum annual GSTC payment amounts for the 2019-20
  benefit year. The average boost to income for those benefitting from this measure will be close to $400 for
  single individuals and close to $600 for couples. This measure will inject $5.5 billion into the economy.
</p>

<p> For over 3.5 million families with children, who may also require additional support, the Government is
  proposing to increase the maximum annual Canada Child Benefit (CCB) payment amounts, only for the 2019-20
  benefit year, by $300 per child. The overall increase for families receiving CCB will be approximately $550
  on average; these families will receive an extra $300 per child as part of their May payment. In total,
  this measure will deliver almost $2 billion in extra support. </p>

<p> Together, the proposed enhancements of the GSTC and CCB will give a single parent with two children and low
  to modest income nearly $1,500 in additional short-term support. </p>

<p> To ensure that certain groups who may be vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19 have the support they need,
  the Government is proposing targeted help by: </p>

<ul>

  <li>Providing $305 million for a new distinctions-based Indigenous Community Support Fund to address
    immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation communities. </li>

  <li>Placing a six-month interest-free moratorium on the repayment of Canada Student Loans for all
    individuals currently in the process of repaying these loans.</li>

  <li>Reducing required minimum withdrawals from Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) by 25% for 2020,
    in recognition of volatile market conditions and their impact on many seniors’ retirement
    savings. This will provide flexibility to seniors that are concerned that they may be required to
    liquidate their RRIF assets to meet minimum withdrawal requirements. Similar rules would apply to
    individuals receiving variable benefit payments under a defined contribution Registered Pension Plan.
  </li>

  <li>Providing the Reaching Home initiative with $157.5 million to continue to support people experiencing
    homelessness during the COVID-19 outbreak. The funding could be used for a range of needs such as
    purchasing beds and physical barriers for social distancing and securing accommodation to reduce
    overcrowding in shelters. </li>

  <li>Supporting women and children fleeing violence, by providing up to $50 million to women’s
    shelters and sexual assault centres to help with their capacity to manage or prevent an outbreak in
    their facilities. This includes funding for facilities in Indigenous communities. </li>

</ul>

<h2 id="a4">Flexibility for taxpayers</h2>

<p>In order to provide greater flexibility to Canadians who may be experiencing hardships during the COVID-19
  outbreak, the Canada Revenue Agency will defer the filing due date for the 2019 tax returns of individuals,
  including certain trusts.&nbsp; </p>

<ul>

  <li>For individuals (other than trusts), the return filing due date will be deferred until June 1, 2020.
    &nbsp;However, the Agency encourages individuals who expect to receive benefits under the GSTC or the
    Canada Child Benefit not to delay the filing of their return to ensure their entitlements for the
    2020-21 benefit year are properly determined.</li>

  <li>For trusts having a taxation year ending on December 31, 2019, the return filing due date will be
    deferred until May 1, 2020.</li>

</ul>

<p>The Canada Revenue Agency will allow all taxpayers to defer, until after August 31, 2020, the payment of any
  income tax amounts that become owing on or after today and before September 2020. This relief would apply
  to tax balances due, as well as instalments, under Part I of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>. No interest or
  penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period.&nbsp;</p>

<p> In order to reduce the necessity for taxpayers and tax preparers to meet in person during this difficult
  time, and to reduce administrative burden, effective immediately the Canada Revenue Agency will recognize
  electronic signatures as having met the signature requirements of the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, as a
  temporary administrative measure. This provision applies to authorization forms T183 or T183CORP, which are
  forms that are signed in person by millions of Canadians every year to authorize tax preparers to file
  taxes. </p>

<p> The Canada Revenue Agency is adapting its Outreach Program to support individuals during COVID-19. Through
  this service, the Canada Revenue Agency offers help to individuals to better understand their tax
  obligations and to obtain the benefits and credits to which they are entitled. Traditionally available
  in-person, this service is now available over the phone, and through webinar, where possible. </p>

<p> The Canada Revenue Agency fully expects that many community organizations are considering whether to
  significantly reduce or perhaps cancel the provision of services provided under the Community Volunteer
  Income Tax Program. Additional efforts to encourage individuals to file their tax and benefit returns
  electronically, or where possible, through the File My Return service, will be put forward. </p>
