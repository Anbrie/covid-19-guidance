    <h2 id="business_credit_availability_program">More business credit</h2>
    <p>The&nbsp;Business Credit  Availability Program (BCAP)&nbsp;will allow the Business Development  Bank of Canada (BDC) and Export Development Canada (EDC) to provide more than  $10&nbsp;billion of additional support, largely targeted to small and  medium-sized businesses. This will be an effective tool for helping viable Canadian  businesses remain resilient during these very uncertain times. BDC and EDC are  cooperating with private sector lenders to coordinate on credit solutions for  individual businesses, including in sectors such as oil and gas, air  transportation and tourism.</p>
    <p>The near term credit available to farmers and the  agri-food sector will also be increased through Farm Credit Canada.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 id="lowering_th e_domestic_stability_buffer">Lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer</h2>
    <p>The Office of the Superintendent of Financial  Institutions (OSFI) announced it is lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer by 1.25% of  risk-weighted assets, effective immediately. This action will allow Canada’s  large banks to inject $300 billion of additional lending in to the economy.</p>
  </section> 

  <section>
    <h2 id="cutting_interest_rate">Cutting the interest rate</h2>
    <p>The Bank of Canada also took a series of  actions to support the Canadian economy during this period of economic stress,  enhance the resilience of the Canadian financial system, and help ensure that  financial institutions can continue to extend credit to both households and  businesses. This included cutting the interest rate to 0.75% as a proactive  measure in light of the negative shocks to Canada’s economy arising from the  COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices. </p>
