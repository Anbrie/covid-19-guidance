	<h2><a name="s"></a>COVID-19 symptoms </h2>
	<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. They may also vary  in different age groups. </p>
	<p>Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
	  <li>new or       worsening cough</li>
	  <li>shortness of       breath or difficulty breathing</li>
	  <li>temperature       equal to or over 38°C</li>
	  <li>feeling       feverish</li>
	  <li>chills</li>
	  <li>fatigue or       weakness</li>
	  <li>muscle or       body aches</li>
	  <li>new loss of       smell or taste</li>
	  <li>headache</li>
	  <li>gastrointestinal       symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)</li>
	  <li>feeling very       unwell</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Children tend to have abdominal symptoms and skin  changes or rashes.</p>
	<p>Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.</p>
	<h3>You can infect others even if you aren’t showing symptoms</h3>

	<p>The virus can be spread to others from someone who’s infected but not  showing symptoms. This includes people who:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
	  <li>haven’t yet       developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)</li>
	  <li>never develop       symptoms (asymptomatic)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This kind of spread is known to happen among those who are in close  contact or are in enclosed or crowded settings. </p>
	<p>Think you may have been exposed to COVID-19? Follow the <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-home-exposed-no-symptoms.html">advice on how to quarantine at home when you may  have been exposed but have no symptoms</a>.</p>
	<p>If you're travelling with or without symptoms, be aware of what’s expected of you when entering Canada.</p>

	</ul>
	<h2><a name="i"></a>If you’re sick or caring for someone who’s sick </h2>

	<p>If you’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, contact your <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">local  public health authority</a> and <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html">isolate&nbsp;yourself at home</a> for 14 days to avoid spreading it to  others. Most people with mild symptoms will recover on their own.</p>
	<p>Adults and children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at  home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing  hospitalization. If you’re a caregiver, follow the <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/how-care-someone-covid-19-home.html">advice on how to care for someone with COVID-19 at  home</a>.</p>
	<h2><a name="_Getting_tested"></a>Getting  tested</h2>

	<p>The only way to confirm you have COVID-19 is through a&nbsp;<a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/testing.html">laboratory  test</a>. </p>
	<p><a href="https://ca.thrive.health/covid19/en">Take  a self-assessment</a> to  find out if you should be tested.</p>
	<h3><a name="_If_you_have"></a>If you’ve tested positive</h3>

	<p>If you've received a positive test result for COVID-19, you must&nbsp;<a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html">isolate  at home</a>, whether you have  symptoms or not. Remain isolated for up to 14 days&nbsp;<strong>or</strong>&nbsp;as  directed by your local <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">public health authority</a>.</p>
	<p>If you didn’t have symptoms when you got  tested but develop them during your isolation period, you must restart your  isolation time as directed by the local public health authority.</p>
	<h2><a name="t"></a>Treating  COVID-19 </h2>

	<p>If you’re concerned about your symptoms, self-monitor for any changes  and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to  relieve your symptoms.</p>
	<p>People who are hospitalized  with COVID-19 and need breathing assistance may be treated with dexamethasone. </p>
	<p>Remdesivir (brand name Veklury) is currently  the only drug authorized with conditions to treat COVID-19 in those who are hospitalized with  severe symptoms. The drug can be used with adults and youth (aged 12 years and  older).</p>
	<p>Certain  medications can also help to ease symptoms like fever  and cough. </p>
	<p>Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments.html">vaccines  and treatments being developed for COVID-19</a>.</p>
	<h2><a name="_Vaccination_for_COVID-19"></a>Vaccination for COVID-19 </h2>

	<p>There isn’t yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, but research and  development are underway. The Government of Canada is closely tracking all  potential drugs and vaccines in development in Canada and abroad. To help speed  up the development and availability of treatments as well as vaccines to  prevent COVID-19, Canada is working with:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>companies</li>
	  <li>academic  research centres </li>
	  <li>investigators </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Flu vaccine</h4>
	<p>Getting your annual flu shot is an important way to help protect  yourself, your family and vulnerable people in your community against seasonal  flu. It will also help reduce the burden on Canada’s health care system during  this unprecedented time. </p>
	<p>The flu shot will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;protect  against COVID-19, but it will help reduce your risk of getting the flu and  COVID-19 at the same time. Having both illnesses at the same time could put you  at a higher risk for severe illness. &nbsp;</p>
	<p>Getting the flu shot will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;increase your risk of  illness from COVID-19. For more information, please refer to this <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa626/5842161">Canadian  research study</a>. </p>
