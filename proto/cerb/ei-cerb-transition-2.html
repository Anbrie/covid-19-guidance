<h2 id="transition">Transition from <abbr>CERB</abbr> to Employment Insurance (<abbr>EI</abbr>) </h2>

<div class="alert alert-info provisional">
<p><strong>Auto-transition</strong>: To ensure a smooth transition from <abbr>CERB</abbr> to <abbr>EI</abbr> benefits for all those affected, Service Canada is proactively reaching out to certain Canadians and notifying them that they will not be automatically transitioned and will have to apply for <abbr>EI</abbr>.</p>
</div>

<p>As of September 27, 2020, there are  some temporary changes to the <abbr>EI</abbr> program to help you access <abbr>EI</abbr> benefits. These  changes will be in effect for 1 year. Go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei.html">EI benefits and leave</a> to find the benefit type that applies to your  situation.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-transition">How  to transition to <abbr>EI</abbr> from <abbr>CERB</abbr></h3>
<p>	Canadians already receiving benefits  through Service Canada will be transitioned to the <abbr>EI</abbr> program once they have  received the maximum <abbr>CERB</abbr> benefits for which they are entitled, if they are <abbr>EI</abbr>  eligible and continue to need income support.</p>
<p>	Canadians who are currently receiving  the <abbr>CERB</abbr> from the Canada Revenue Agency (<abbr>CRA</abbr>) who believe they are entitled to <abbr>EI</abbr> will need to apply through Service Canada after September 26.</p>
<h2 id="not-eligible">If you’re not eligible for <abbr>EI</abbr> benefits</h2>
<p>	You may be eligible for other new  benefits, including the Canada Recovery Benefit, the Canada Recovery Sickness  Benefit, and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit.</p>
<p>	The Government of Canada intends to  introduce legislation to support the delivery of the new recovery benefits.</p>
<h3>How to apply</h3>
<p>	The Canada Revenue Agency (<abbr>CRA</abbr>) would  administer the Canada Recovery Benefits, and Canadians would be able to apply  through the CRA.</p>
<h4 id="recovery">Canada Recovery Benefit</h4>
<p>	The new Canada Recovery Benefit would  be effective from September 27, 2020 for one year and would provide a benefit  amount of $400 per week for up to 26 weeks to workers who are not eligible for  <abbr>EI</abbr>, mainly the self-employed and including those working in the gig economy.  These individuals may still require income support if they continue to be  unable to return to work due to COVID-19 or had their income reduced relative  to pre-COVID-19 pandemic (attestation-based).</p>
<details>
<summary>Eligibility</summary>
<p>The benefit would be available to  residents in Canada who:</p>
<ul>
<li>are at least 15 years old and have a valid Social Insurance Number (<abbr>SIN</abbr>);</li>
<li>have stopped working due to the COVID-19 pandemic and are available and looking for work; or are working and have had a reduction in their       employment/self-employment income for reasons related to COVID-19;</li>
<li>are not eligible for Employment Insurance;</li>
<li>had employment and/or self-employment income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in 2020; and,</li>
<li>have not quit their job voluntarily.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>While receiving the benefit</summary>
<p>Workers would apply after every  two-week period for which they are seeking income support and attest that they  continue to meet the requirements. In order to continue to be eligible for the  benefit the claimant wound need to look for and accept work when it is  reasonable to do so. The benefit is taxable.</p>
<p>To encourage claimants to return to  work, they would be able to earn income from employment and/or self-employment  while receiving the benefit, as long as they continue to meet the other  requirements. However, to ensure that the benefit targets those who need it  most, claimants would need to repay some or all of the benefit through their  income tax return if their annual net income, excluding the Canada Recovery  Benefit payment, is over $38,000. In other words, claimants would need to repay  $0.50 of the benefit for each dollar of their annual net income above $38,000  in the calendar year to a maximum of the amount of benefit they received.</p>
<p>This means that for a worker who  received 10 weeks of the Canada Recovery Benefit in 2020 for a total of $4000,  they would have to repay all of the benefit if their net income exceeded the  threshold by $8000 (twice the benefit payment amount). In this example, the  worker would have to repay the full benefit amount if their net income was  greater than $46,000 (not including the Canada Recovery Benefit) in 2020.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Example: Self-employed worker</summary>
<p>Self-employed worker whose business is affected by  the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
<ul>
<li>Ibrahim is a self-employed bookkeeper in Toronto, ON</li>
<li>He earned $34,000 in 2019 but his business has slowed due to COVID-19.</li>
<li>Ibrahim applied for and received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (<abbr>CERB</abbr>) but his benefits will run out in September.</li>
<li>While his business has begun to rebound, it is still not business as usual and he is only back to working at 40% capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>What could Ibrahim qualify for?</p>
<ul>
<li>With the Canada Recovery Benefit, he could receive $400 per week for up to 26 weeks.</li>
<li>If his annual net income for 2020 is above $38,000 (excluding the Canada Recovery Benefit payments), he would need to repay some or all of the benefit when he files his annual income tax return for 2020.</li>
</ul>

</details>


<h4 id="sickness">Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit</h4>
<p>	The new Canada Recovery Sickness  Benefit would provide $500 per week, for up to two weeks, effective September  27, 2020 for one year, for workers who are unable to work because they are sick  or must self-isolate due to COVID-19. This new benefit would fulfil the Government  of Canada’s commitment as part of the Safe Restart Agreement with provinces and  territories to provide up to two weeks of sick leave to all Canadians in the  context of COVID-19.</p>
<details>
<summary>Eligibility</summary>
<p>The benefit would be available to:</p>
<ul>
<li>residents in Canada who are at least 15 years of age and have a valid Social Insurance Number (<abbr>SIN</abbr>);</li>
<li>workers employed or self-employed at the time of the application; and</li>
<li>workers who earned at least $5,000 in 2019 or in 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>Workers would not be required to have  a medical certificate to qualify for the benefit. </p>

</details>


<details>
<summary>While receiving the benefit</summary>
<p>Workers could not claim the Canada  Recovery Sickness Benefit and receive other paid sick leave for the same  benefit period. Workers would need to have missed a minimum of 60% of their  scheduled work in the week for which they claim the benefit.</p>
<p>Workers would apply after the  one-week period in which they are seeking income support and attest that they  meet the requirements. The benefit would taxable.</p>

<h4 id="caregiving">Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit</h4>
<p>	The new Canada Recovery Caregiver Benefit, would be effective from September 27, 2020 for one year, and provide  $500 per week, for up to 26 weeks per household to eligible Canadians.</p>
<p>The closure of schools and other  daycare and day program facilities to prevent the spread of COVID 19 has meant  that many Canadians have been unable to work because they needed to provide  care to children or support to other dependents who had to stay home. While it  is anticipated that facilities will gradually re-open as the economy restarts,  the Government of Canada recognizes that access may vary over time and across  communities. The Government is committed to ensuring that parents and others  with dependents do not need to choose between caring for them and paying the  bills.</p>
