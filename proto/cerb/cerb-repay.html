<h2>When to return or repay the CERB</h2>
<p>You may want to return or be required to repay to the CERB to the department 
(CRA or Service Canada) that issued you the CERB payment if you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>return to work earlier than expected, including being paid 
  retroactively</li>
  <li>applied for CERB but later realize you are not eligible </li></ul>
<p>Return or repay the CERB to the CRA if you</p>
<ul>
  <li>applied for and received the CERB from CRA and Service Canada for the same 
  eligibility period </li></ul>
<h3>Information slip issuance</h3>
<p>Since the CERB is taxable, you can expect to receive an information slip 
indicating the total amounts of CERB payments you received in 2019.   </p>
<p>However, if you repay all or a portion of the CERB payments you received, 
regardless of the reason, your account will be adjusted accordingly. You will 
not receive an information slip for the payment(s) that have been returned prior 
to December 31, 2020.  </p>
<div class="well">
<p><strong>We encourage you to repay your CERB before December 31, 2020.   
</strong></p></div>

<p>ESDC Remittances<br>	PO Box 1122<br>	Matane QC G4W 4S7</p>
<p>Since the CERB is taxable, you can expect to receive an information slip on 
the amount of CERB you received.</p>
<p>Service Canada will reverse the transaction if you repay the CERB for 
whatever reason, and you will not receive an information slip for that payment.  
</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the information slips are not issued improperly, we 
encourage you to repay your CERB before December 31, 2020.  If you need more 
time to repay based on your personal situation, please contact the CRA or visit 
the CRA payment page to ensure that by December 31st you have made the necessary 
arrangements to payback based on agreed upon schedule.</p></details>
<h2>Verifying eligibility</h2>
<p>The CRA has provided convenient ways for individuals to get the CERB as 
quickly as possible.  Most people are able to complete the application in under 
2 minutes, and receive payments through direct deposit within 2 business 
days.</p>
<p>The CRA also needs to ensure that the CERB was paid to individuals who are 
eligible.</p>
<p>As a result, the CRA will be comparing the payroll records of employers with 
the information of CERB claimants to ensure individuals that have returned to 
work and have become ineligible for the CERB repay those amounts.</p></div>
