  <p>An eligibility period is a fixed 4-week payment period. Each period has a pre-set start and end date. This means when you apply for the CERB, you will receive a payment for a specific 4-week period.</p>
  <p>If your situation continues, you can re-apply for another 4-week period, for up to a maximum of 4 periods (or 16 weeks in all). </p>
