<p>If you are able to work, you must be actively looking for a job at least 3 days per week to be eligible to receive the CESB for that period. If you still cannot find work due to COVID-19, you can re-apply for each CESB eligibility period that you are eligible for.</p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may ask you to provide information later to verify that you have been looking for work during the eligibility period(s) you have applied for, so it is important to keep track of your daily job search activities.</p> 
<p>The CRA may ask you to provide:</p>
<ul>
	<li>dates you applied for jobs or searched for jobs online, including tools or websites used, type of work you looked for, and your search results</li>	
	<li>emails sent and responses from prospective employers, including their names and contact information</li>
	<li>emails, screenshots or other documents showing:
		<ul> 
			<li>job applications you submitted</li>
			<li>job interviews (in-person, by phone, or virtually) you attended</li>
			<li>job search workshops or job fairs (virtual or in-person) you attended</li>
			<li>regular contact with an employment agency</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>links to job postings or screenshots of job ads, flyers within your local area</li>
</ul>	
<p>Registering with the  <a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/report_note.do?cid=16137">Government of Canada Job Bank</a> is an easy way for you to show that you are actively looking for work.  Once registered, the Job Bank will notify you of current jobs available in your field and location, as well as jobs available in essential sectors. You can also use the Job Bank to find tips to  help you update your resume and explore career options. By using Job Bank, you can keep track of your job search activities in one place.</p>

                  <h2 id="h-2">Re-apply for the CESB</h2>

                  
<p>To re-apply for another CESB period, you must continue to meet all the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit/cesb-who-apply.html">eligibility criteria</a>. For each period you are applying for, be sure one of the following still applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are unable to work due to COVID-19</li>
<li>You are actively looking for, but cannot find work due to COVID-19</li>
<li>You are currently working during the COVID-19 pandemic, but you expect your income from employment and self-employment to be $1,000 or less (before taxes) during the 4-week period you are applying for</li>
</ul>
		       <p>You must re-apply for each 4-week period separately. To find the earliest day to re-apply for each period, refer to: <a href="how-apply.html#determine">Determine when to re-apply</a> </p>
<div class="alert alert-warning provisional">
<p>The CRA will verify that you are eligible to receive the CESB. If you received a CESB payment that you are not eligible for, we will contact you to make arrangements to repay any amounts you may owe. Canadians can also report suspected CESB misuse through the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html">CRA’s Leads program</a>.</p>

                <section>
                  <h2 id="h-3">When and how to expect your payment</h2>
                <p>If you are eligible for the CESB, you can expect $1,250 for the 4-week eligibility period you applied for, or $2,000 for those who have dependants or a disability.</p>

<p>The fastest way to get your payment is to make sure your <a href="how-apply.html#deposit">direct deposit</a> is set up.  Direct deposit is paid in 3 business days, otherwise you should get a cheque in about 10 business days.</p>
