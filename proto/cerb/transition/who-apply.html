 <h3>Seeking work opportunities </h3>
 <p>The CERB is available to provide support to those who are unable to work due to COVID-19. Workers should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so. You are encouraged to consult <a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/findajob/resources/cerb">Job Bank</a>, Canada’s national employment service that offers tools to help with your job search.</p>
 <h3>For students who are  not eligible for the CERB </h3>
 <p>Post-secondary and graduating high school students may be eligible for the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit.html">Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB)</a>. </p>
 <h2>Verifying your eligibility</h2>
<p>The CRA will be  verifying that you are eligible to receive the benefit. You may receive a  notice from the CRA asking you to contact the CRA to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/apply-for-cerb-with-cra/keep-payment.html#validate">validate  your application</a>. This is needed to verify your information and  process your application. </p>
<p>  In cases where  claimants have received a payment and are later found to be ineligible, they  will be contacted to make arrangements to repay any applicable amounts.  Canadians can also report suspected CERB misuse through the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html">CRA's Leads program</a>.</p>
<p>  As part of the Canada Emergency Wage  Subsidy, the CRA will also be comparing employers' payroll records with  information provided by CERB claimants to ensure that individuals who have  returned to work and who have therefore become ineligible for the CERB repay  those amounts. </p>
