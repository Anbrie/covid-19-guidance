<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

<!-- hide duplicate questions
<details>
<summary>What  are the eligibility criteria for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>The Benefit is available to workers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Residing in Canada, who are at least 15 years old; </li>
  <li>Who have stopped working because of reasons related to COVID-19 <u>or</u> are eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits <u>or</u> have exhausted their Employment Insurance regular benefits between December       29, 2019 and October 3, 2020; </li>

  <li>Who have not quit their job voluntarily.</li>
</ul>
<p>When  submitting your first claim, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in  employment and/or self-employment income for 14 or more consecutive days within  the four-week benefit period of your claim. </p>
<p>When  submitting subsequent claims, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in  employment and/or self-employment income for the entire four-week benefit  period of your new claim. </p>
<p>Provided  it is allowed in your province or territory, you may also receive provincial or  territorial support payments at the same time you receive the Canada Emergency  Response Benefit.</p>
</details>
-->

<details>
<summary>What income types count towards the $5,000 in employment and/or self-employment income?</summary>
<p>The $5,000 includes all employment and self-employment income. This includes among others: tips you have declared as income; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (e.g., nominal amounts paid to emergency service volunteers); and royalties (e.g., paid to artists). If you are not eligible for Employment Insurance, you may also include maternity and parental benefits you received from the Employment Insurance program and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.</p>
<p>Pensions, student loans and bursaries are not considered employment income and should not be included.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Does  the minimum income of $5,000 have to be earned in Canada? </summary>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The income does not have to be earned in Canada,  but you need to reside in Canada.</p>
</details>

	<details>
<summary>What  counts towards the $1,000 in income I can earn? </summary>
<p>The $1,000 includes employment and/or self-employment income. This includes among others: tips you may earn while working; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (e.g., nominal amounts paid to emergency service volunteers); and royalties (e.g., paid to artists).</p>
<p>However, royalty payments received from work that took place before the period for which a person applies for the CERB do not count as income during that specific benefit period.</p>
<p> Pensions, student loans and bursaries are not  employment income and therefore, should not be included in the $1000.</p>
<p> Applications will be verified against tax records  to confirm income.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Do  I need to be laid off to access the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>No.</p>
<p> Workers who remain attached to their company can  receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if they meet the eligibility  requirements.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Can  you receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if you are not a citizen or  permanent resident? </summary>
<p>Yes if you meet the eligibility requirements, which  includes residing in Canada and having a valid Social Insurance Number.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I am on special benefits such as maternity/parental am I eligible to apply for  the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>If there is no work available when you finish  collecting maternity/parental benefits, you would be considered to have stopped  working due to COVID-19.  If you meet the  other eligibility requirements you may receive the Canada Emergency Response  Benefit.  </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I am in receipt of dividends am I eligible for the Canada Emergency Response  Benefit? </summary>
<p>Yes as long as the  dividends are non-eligible dividends (generally those paid out of corporate  income taxed at the small business rate) and you meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p> Non-eligible  dividends count towards the minimum $5000 in income required for eligibility.  Non-eligible dividends also count toward the  $1000 income threshold for a benefit period.</p>
</details>



<h2 id="ei">Employment Insurance</h2>

<details>
<summary>If  I am already receiving Employment Insurance regular benefits, should I reapply  for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>No.</p>
<p> If you are already receiving Employment Insurance  regular benefits, you will continue to receive these benefits until the end of  your benefit period.</p>
<p> You cannot be paid Employment Insurance benefits  and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>I  have applied for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits, but my  claim hasn’t been processed yet, do I need to reapply for the Canada Emergency  Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>No. You should not submit another application for  the same benefit period.</p>
<p> Service Canada is processing all of these claims as  quickly as possible.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I would be entitled to more than the $500 per week under Employment Insurance,  will I get the higher amount? </summary>
<p>No.</p>
<p> You will receive $500 per week, regardless of what  you may have been eligible to receive through Employment Insurance. </p>
<p> However, once you are finished receiving the Canada  Emergency Response Benefit, you will still be eligible to receive Employment  Insurance at the higher rate provided you cannot find a job.  Getting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit  does not affect your EI entitlement. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I would have been entitled to less than the $500 per week under Employment  Insurance, will I get the $500? </summary>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> You will receive $500 per week, regardless of what  you may have been eligible to receive through Employment Insurance.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What  if I stopped working before March 15th but only applied for Employment  Insurance after March 15th – which benefit will I receive? </summary>
<p>If you became eligible for Employment Insurance  regular or sickness benefits before March 15th, your claim will be processed  under the pre-existing Employment Insurance rules.  You will not receive the Canada Emergency  Response Benefit.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>I haven't received my payment through Service Canada </summary>
<p>To keep receiving EI or CERB payments from Service Canada, you must complete EI reports <strong>every 2 weeks</strong>, whether your application was for EI or CERB, and even if it was submitted after March 15, 2020. To do this, you must have received an access code.

</details>








<h2 id="getting">Getting CERB</h2>
<details>
<summary>How  much could I receive through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>If you meet the eligibility requirements, you would  receive $500 per week to a maximum of 16 weeks. </p>
<p> The Benefit is taxable -- you will be expected to  report it as income when you file your income tax for the 2020 tax year.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>When and how will I  receive my Canada Emergency Response Benefit payment? Is there a waiting  period? </summary>
