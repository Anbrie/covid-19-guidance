<summary>What  is the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>The Canada Emergency Response Benefit provides  temporary income support to workers who have stopped working related to  COVID-19.</p>
<p> Individuals  who are eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits may also  be eligible. </p>
<p>The new Canada Emergency Response Benefit provides  $500 per week for a maximum of 16 weeks. </p>
<p> The Benefit is available from March 15, 2020, to  October 3, 2020. You can apply no later than December 2, 2020 for payments  retroactive to within that period. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How  do I know whether to apply for EI benefits or the Canada Emergency Response  Benefit? </summary>
<p>If you have stopped working because of COVID-19,  you should apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p>
<p> A single portal is available to assist you with the  application process. You will be asked to answer a few simple questions which  will help direct you to complete the application best suited to your situation.</p>
<p>For anyone who became eligible for EI regular or  sickness benefits on March 15, 2020 or later, your Employment Insurance claim  will be automatically processed through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.  </p>
<p>For other Employment Insurance benefits, including  maternity, parental, caregiving, fishing and work-sharing, you should continue  to <a href="/en/services/benefits/ei.html">apply</a> as  you normally would.</p>
</details>

<summary>What  are the eligibility criteria for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>The Benefit is available to workers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Residing in Canada, who are at least 15 years old; </li>
  <li>Who have stopped working because of reasons related to COVID-19 <u>or</u> are eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits <u>or</u> have exhausted their Employment Insurance regular benefits between December       29, 2019 and October 3, 2020; </li>
  <li>Who had employment and/or self-employment income of at least $5,000       in 2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of their application; and,</li>
  <li>Who have not quit their job voluntarily.</li>
</ul>
<p>When  submitting your first claim, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in  employment and/or self-employment income for 14 or more consecutive days within  the four-week benefit period of your claim. </p>
<p>When  submitting subsequent claims, you cannot have earned more than $1,000 in  employment and/or self-employment income for the entire four-week benefit  period of your new claim. </p>
<p>Provided  it is allowed in your province or territory, you may also receive provincial or  territorial support payments at the same time you receive the Canada Emergency  Response Benefit.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What income types  of count towards the $5,000 in employment and/or self-employment income?</summary>
<p>The $5,000 includes all employment and self-employment income. This includes among others: tips you have declared as income; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (e.g., nominal amounts paid to emergency service volunteers); and royalties (e.g., paid to artists). If you are not eligible for Employment Insurance, you may also include maternity and parental benefits you received from the Employment Insurance program and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.</p>
<p>Pensions, student loans and bursaries are not considered employment income and should not be included.</p>
</details>
	<details>
<summary>What  counts towards the $1,000 in income I can earn? </summary>
<p>The $1,000 includes employment and/or self-employment income. This includes among others: tips you may earn while working; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (e.g., nominal amounts paid to emergency service volunteers); and royalties (e.g., paid to artists).</p>
<p>However, royalty payments received from work that took place before the period for which a person applies for the CERB do not count as income during that specific benefit period.</p>        
<p> Pensions, student loans and bursaries are not  employment income and therefore, should not be included in the $1000.</p>
<p> Applications will be verified against tax records  to confirm income.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Do  I need to be laid off to access the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>

<p>If you meet the eligibility requirements, you would  receive $500 per week to a maximum of 16 weeks. </p>
<p> The Benefit is taxable -- you will be expected to  report it as income when you file your income tax for the 2020 tax year.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>When and how will I  receive my Canada Emergency Response Benefit payment? Is there a waiting  period? </summary>

<summary>Do  I need a medical certificate to receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit  if I am in quarantine or sick from COVID-19? </summary>
<p>No. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Can  you receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if you are not a citizen or  permanent resident? </summary>
<p>Yes if you meet the eligibility requirements, which  includes residing in Canada and having a valid Social Insurance Number.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Does  the minimum income of $5,000 have to be earned in Canada? </summary>
<p>No.</p>

</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I am already receiving Employment Insurance regular benefits, should I reapply  for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>No.</p>

<p> You cannot be paid Employment Insurance benefits  and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>I  have applied for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits, but my  claim hasn’t been processed yet, do I need to reapply for the Canada Emergency  Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>No. You should not submit another application for  the same benefit period.</p>
<p> Service Canada is processing all of these claims as  quickly as possible.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I would be entitled to more than the $500 per week under Employment Insurance,  will I get the higher amount? </summary>
<p>No.</p>
<p> You will receive $500 per week, regardless of what  you may have been eligible to receive through Employment Insurance. </p>
<p> However, once you are finished receiving the Canada  Emergency Response Benefit, you will still be eligible to receive Employment  Insurance at the higher rate provided you cannot find a job.  Getting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit  does not affect your EI entitlement. </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I would have been entitled to less than the $500 per week under Employment  Insurance, will I get the $500? </summary>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> You will receive $500 per week, regardless of what  you may have been eligible to receive through Employment Insurance.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What  if I stopped working before March 15th but only applied for Employment  Insurance after March 15th – which benefit will I receive? </summary>
<p>If you became eligible for Employment Insurance  regular or sickness benefits before March 15th, your claim will be processed  under the pre-existing Employment Insurance rules.  You will not receive the Canada Emergency  Response Benefit.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I am on special benefits such as maternity/parental am I eligible to apply for  the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? </summary>
<p>If there is no work available when you finish  collecting maternity/parental benefits, you would be considered to have stopped  working due to COVID-19.  If you meet the  other eligibility requirements you may receive the Canada Emergency Response  Benefit.  </p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>If  I am in receipt of dividends am I eligible for the Canada Emergency Response  Benefit? </summary>
<p>Yes as long as the  dividends are non-eligible dividends (generally those paid out of corporate  income taxed at the small business rate) and you meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p> Non-eligible  dividends count towards the minimum $5000 in income required for eligibility.  Non-eligible dividends also count toward the  $1000 income threshold for a benefit period.</p>
