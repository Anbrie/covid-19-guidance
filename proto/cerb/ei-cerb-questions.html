		<p>Where can I apply for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p>You can apply <a href="/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html">here</a>. </p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>Can I apply for the CERB over the phone, or only online?&nbsp; What if I don’t have access to a computer at my
			house and I must self-isolate?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> The best way for you to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit is <a
			href="/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html">online</a>. However, if you do not have online access, you
		can apply for the Benefit using the toll free number 1-833-966-2099.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> Under what circumstances can I apply for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p>The Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available to those who stop working for reasons related to COVID-19, for
		example: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>You have lost your job;</li>
		<li>You are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;</li>
		<li>You are taking care of others because they are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19; and/or</li>
		<li>You are taking care of children or other dependents because their care facility is closed due to COVID-19.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There may be other reasons related to COVID-19 beyond these examples why you may have stopped working. However, you
		<u>cannot </u>voluntarily quit your job. </p>
	<p>Alternatively, you can apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You are eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits; or</li>
		<li>You are a former Employment Insurance claimant who used up your entitlement to your Employment Insurance regular
			or fishing benefits between December 29, 2019 and October 3, 2020.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To get the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, you may not earn more than $1,000 for a period of at least 14
		consecutive days within the initial four week period of your claim or $1000 in total for each subsequent claim.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> How do I know whether to apply for EI benefits or the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> If you have stopped working because of COVID-19, you should apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p>
	<p> A single portal is available to assist you with the application process. You will be asked to answer a few simple
		questions which will help direct you to complete the application best suited to your situation.</p>
	<p> For anyone who became eligible for EI regular or sickness benefits on March 15, 2020 or later, your Employment
		Insurance claim will be automatically processed through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. </p>
	<p> For other Employment Insurance benefits, including maternity, parental, caregiving, fishing and work-sharing, you
		should continue to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei.html">apply</a> as you normally would.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>If I am already receiving EI regular benefits, should I reapply for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> No.</p>
	<p> If you are already receiving Employment Insurance regular benefits, you will continue to receive these benefits
		until the end of your benefit period.</p>
	<p> You cannot be paid Employment Insurance benefits and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for the same period.
	</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> I have applied for EI regular or sickness benefits, but my claim hasn’t been processed yet, do I need to reapply
			for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> No. You should not submit another application for the same benefit period.</p>
	<p> Service Canada is processing all of these claims as quickly as possible.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>What if I stopped working before March 15th but only applied for EI after March 15th – which benefit will I
			receive?</p>
	</summary>
	<p>If you became eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits before March 15th, your claim will be
		processed under the pre-existing Employment Insurance rules. You will not receive the Canada Emergency Response
		Benefit. </p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>How is the maximum of 16 weeks calculated? Is it when I apply or when I receive my first payment? Can I collect
			the 16 week CERB twice – once through Service Canada and once through the Canada Revenue Agency?</p>
	</summary>
	<p>Service Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency are jointly delivering the Canada Emergency</p>
	<p>Response Benefit and an individual may only receive a maximum of 16 weeks in total within the eligibility period
		from March 15, 2020 to October 3, 2020. You can either apply for the Benefit through Service Canada or the Canada
		Revenue Agency, <strong>but not both</strong>.</p>
	<p> The calculation of the 16 weeks begins with the first week for which you are receiving the Benefit. However, the
		16 weeks do not have to be taken consecutively. For example, you could receive the Benefit for 4 weeks beginning
		March 15th and reapply for your second benefit period a few months later based on your personal situation. </p>
	<p> Please note that the 16 week count does not restart when you reapply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit
		after taking a break because you found employment.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>Do I need to provide any documentation when I apply for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> You will need to provide your personal contact information, your Social Insurance Number and confirm that you meet
		the eligibility requirements. </p>
	<p> You may be asked to provide additional documentation to verify your eligibility at a future date.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>Do I need a medical certificate to receive the CERB if I am in quarantine or sick from COVID-19?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> No. </p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>Is a Record of Employment required to apply for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> A Record of Employment is not required to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p>
	<p> However, employers are encouraged to provide a Record of Employment in the event that any employee should
		subsequently apply for Employment Insurance benefits. </p>
</details>

<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

<details>
	<summary>
		<p>What are the eligibility criteria for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p>The Benefit is available to workers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Residing in Canada, who are at least 15 years old; </li>
		<li>Who have stopped working because of reasons related to COVID-19 <u>or</u> are eligible for Employment Insurance

		income for the entire four-week benefit period of your new claim. </p>
	<p>Provided it is allowed in your province or territory, you may also receive provincial or territorial support
		payments at the same time you receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>Do I need to be laid off to access the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> No.</p>
	<p> Workers who remain attached to their company can receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if they meet the
		eligibility requirements.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> Can you receive the CERB if you are not a citizen or permanent resident?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> Yes if you meet the eligibility requirements, which includes residing in Canada and having a valid Social
		Insurance Number.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> Am I eligible for the CERB even if my job is still there but I don’t feel comfortable going to work as a result
			of risk associated with COVID-19? For example, what if I have someone at home who has a compromised immune system
			and I cannot risk infecting them.</p>
	</summary>
	<p> The Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available to those who stop working for reasons related to COVID-19, for
		example: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>You have lost your job;</li>
		<li>You are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;</li>
		<li>You are taking care of others because they are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19; and/or</li>
		<li>You are taking care of children or other dependents because their care facility is closed due to COVID-19.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There may be other reasons related to COVID-19 beyond these examples why you may have stopped working.
		<strong>However, you cannot voluntarily quit your job</strong>. </p>
	<p> If you are concerned about the safety of your working conditions, you should discuss the situation with your
		employer.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you work in a federally-regulated workplace, you may wish to consult your workplace health and safety
			committee or health and safety representative as well as the document “Right to refuse dangerous work” at
			https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/health-safety/reports/right-refuse.html</li>
		<li>Otherwise, you may wish to consult the website for the department of labour in your province or territory for
			further information on your rights and the process you should follow.</li>
		<li>The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (<a
				href="https://www.ccohs.ca/">https://www.ccohs.ca/</a>) is another possible resource.</li>
	</ul>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>Am I eligible to apply for the CERB if I volunteer to be temporarily laid off by my employer to help them manage
			the pressures on their business?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> Yes. You are eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit if you are laid off as a result of</p>
	<p> reasons related to COVID-19, even if you maintain your attachment with your employer. </p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>If I lost my job prior to March 15th for reasons related to COVID-19 will I be able to receive the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> If you became eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits prior to March 15th, your claim will
		be processed under the pre-existing Employment Insurance rules. </p>
	<p> If you are not eligible for Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits and lost your job prior to March
		15th you may be eligible for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit delivered by the Canada Revenue Agency. However,
		the Benefit is only available for periods between March 15 and October 3, 2020.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> Am I eligible to apply for the CERB if I have not declared that I earned any money in the last year?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> While having filed income tax for 2019 is not an eligibility requirement, you will need to confirm when applying
		for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit that you had at least $5000 in employment or self-employment income in
		2019 or in the 12 months prior to the date of your application. You will also need to confirm that you have not
		earned more than $1000 in employment and/or self-employment income in a period of at least 14 consecutive days
		within the first benefit period and for the entire four-week benefit period of any subsequent claim. If you are
		deemed ineligible for the Benefit at a later date, you will be required to pay it back. </p>
	<p> The income of at least $5,000 may be from employment and/or self-employment. For those who are not eligible for
		Employment Insurance you may also include maternity and parental benefits under the Employment Insurance program
		and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan as part of the calculation for
		income.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> Can employers send their employees off on furloughs to help cope with the decline in available work?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> Employers can choose to ask their employees to take a furlough to help meet their business requirements.</p>
	<p> In this case, the employee would be considered to have stopped working (unpaid leave) and eligible for the Canada
		Emergency Response Benefit provided they meet the other eligibility criteria. </p>
	<p> There is no requirement for the employer-employee relationship to be severed and the employee can continue to
		receive other benefits such as medical benefits from the employer and still be eligible for the Benefit.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="income-requirements">Income Requirements </h2>

<details>
	<summary>
		<p>What counts towards the $1,000 in income I can earn?</p>
	</summary>
	<p>The $1,000 includes employment and/or self-employment income. This includes among others: tips you may earn while
		working; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (e.g., nominal amounts paid to emergency service volunteers); and
		royalties (e.g., paid to artists).</p>
	<p> However, royalty payments received from work that took place before the period for which a person applies for the
		Canada Emergency Response Benefit do not count as income during that specific benefit period.</p>
	<p> Pensions, student loans and bursaries are not employment income and therefore, should not be included in the
		$1000.</p>
	<p> Applications will be verified against tax records to confirm income.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>What income types count towards the $5,000 in employment and/or self-employment income?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> The $5,000 includes all employment and self-employment income. This includes among others: tips you have declared
		as income; non-eligible dividends; honoraria (e.g., nominal amounts paid to emergency service volunteers); and
		royalties (e.g., paid to artists). If you are not eligible for Employment Insurance, you may also include maternity
		and parental benefits you received from the Employment Insurance program and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec
		under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan.</p>
	<p> Pensions, student loans and bursaries are not considered employment income and should not be included.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> Does the minimum income of $5,000 have to be earned in Canada?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> No.</p>
	<p> The income does not have to be earned in Canada, but you need to reside in Canada.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>If I am in receipt of dividends am I eligible for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> Yes as long as the dividends are non-eligible dividends (generally those paid out of corporate income taxed at the
		small business rate) and you meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p> Non-eligible dividends count towards the minimum $5000 in income required for eligibility. Non-eligible dividends
		also count toward the $1000 income threshold for a benefit period.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>Do artists’ royalties count as employment or self-employment income with respect to theCERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> Yes, in some cases. Artists’ royalties would be considered payments received as self-employment income if they
		were received as compensation for using or allowing the use of a copyright, patent, trademark, formula or secret
		process that is a result of their own work or invention. These royalties count towards the $5,000 income threshold,
		as well as towards the $1,000 that claimants can earn per month while receiving the Benefit. However, royalty
		payments received from work that took place before the period for which a person applies for the Canada Emergency
		Response Benefit do not count as income during that specific benefit period. Other royalties (i.e., from investment
		activities) do not count with respect to the Benefit.</p>
</details>

<h2 id="payment">Payment</h2>

<details>
	<summary>
		<p>How much could I receive through the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> If you meet the eligibility requirements, you would receive $500 per week to a maximum of 16 weeks. </p>
	<p> The Benefit is taxable -- you will be expected to report it as income when you file your income tax for the 2020
		tax year.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> When and how will I receive my CERB payment? Is there a waiting period?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> There is no waiting period so you will receive your Benefit within 10 days of applying. </p>
	<p> Payments will be made through direct deposit or by cheque; however direct deposit is faster. </p>
	<p> Your payments will be retroactive to the date you became eligible.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> If I would be entitled to more than the $500 per week under EI, will I get the higher amount?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> No.</p>
	<p> You will receive $500 per week, regardless of what you may have been eligible to receive through Employment
		Insurance. </p>
	<p> However, once you are finished receiving the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, you will still be eligible to
		receive Employment Insurance at the higher rate provided you cannot find a job. Getting the Canada Emergency
		Response Benefit does not affect your EI entitlement. </p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> If I would have been entitled to less than the $500 per week under EI, will I get the $500?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> Yes.</p>
	<p> You will receive $500 per week, regardless of what you may have been eligible to receive through Employment
		Insurance.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> What happens if I get a CERB payment I am not entitled to because I applied twice - once to the Canada Revenue
			Agency and once to Service Canada?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> Canadians should only apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit from either Service Canada
		<strong>OR</strong> the Canada Revenue Agency, not both.&nbsp; If you have already applied for Employment Insurance
		benefits but haven’t received your benefits yet, you should not submit another application.</p>
	<p> While there will not be any penalty for Canadians if you have received a payment in error, you will have to repay
		the CERB benefits for which you are not entitled and will receive a letter from the CRA providing you with further
		information about the repayment process.</p>
	<p>Specifically, if you have received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit twice for the same benefit period, you are
		requested to return one of the payments to the Canada Revenue Agency using the following procedure:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you still have the original Canada Emergency Response Benefit cheque, you can return the cheque by mail to
			the address below. </li>
		<li>If you received the payment by direct deposit, or deposited the cheque, you can mail your repayment to the CRA.
			Be sure to:
			<ol>
				<li>Make payment out to “Receiver General for Canada” </li>
				<li>Indicate it is for “Repayment of CERB”</li>
				<li>Include your Social Insurance Number (SIN) or your Temporary Tax Number (TTN) </li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p> Please do not send cash through the mail.</p>
	<p>Please mail your payment to</p>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p> Once I receive my first payment, can I assume I will receive my next payment 4 weeks later?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> No, the renewal of payments will not be automatic. You must confirm your eligibility for each period for which you
		apply either <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html">online</a> or by phone (1-833-966-2099).</p>
	<p> If you are receiving your Benefit through Service Canada you must complete your EI Report Card to confirm your
		eligibility. </p>
</details>


<h2 id="maternity-parental-benefits">Maternity/Parental benefits</h2>
<details>
	<summary>
		<p>If I am on maternity/parental benefits, am I eligible to apply for the CERB?</p>
	</summary>
	<p> You cannot receive maternity or parental benefits at the same time as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. </p>
	<p> If you cannot return to work due to COVID-19 following your maternity/parental leave, you would be considered to
		have stopped working due to COVID-19. If you meet the other eligibility requirements you may receive the Canada
		Emergency Response Benefit. </p>
</details>

<h2 id="students-apprentices">Students/Apprentices </h2>

		criteria. </p>
</details>
<details>

		<p> Does the money I receive through bursaries and/or scholarships count toward the requirement for $5000 in income?
		</p>
	</summary>
	<p> No. Student loans and bursaries do not count toward the $5000 in income.</p>
	<p>The income of at least $5,000 may be from employment and/or self-employment. For those who are not eligible for
		Employment Insurance you may also include maternity and parental benefits under the Employment Insurance program
		and/or similar benefits paid in Quebec under the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan as part of the calculation for
		income.</p>
</details>
