					<p>People with COVID-19 do not always recognize their early <a
							href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#s">symptoms</a>.
						Even if you do not have symptoms now, it is possible to transmit COVID-19 before you start showing symptoms or
						without ever developing symptoms.</p>
					<p>You need to quarantine (self-isolate) for 14 days if, you:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>are returning from travel <strong>outside of Canada</strong> (mandatory quarantine)*</li>
						<li>had close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19</li>
						<li>have been told by public health that you may have been exposed and need to quarantine (self-isolate)</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Quarantine (self-isolate)</strong> means that, <strong>for 14 days</strong> you need to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>stay at home</strong> and monitor yourself for <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#s">symptoms</a>,
							even just one mild symptom </li>
						<li><strong>avoid contact with other people</strong> to help prevent transmission of the virus prior to
							developing symptoms or at the earliest stage of illness </li>
						<li><strong>do your part to prevent the spread of disease</strong> by practicing <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">physical
								distancing</a> in your home</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="well col-md-8">
						<p><strong>If you start to develop symptoms within 14 days of your quarantine, you must:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li><a
									href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html">isolate</a>
								yourself from others as soon as you notice your first symptom</li>
							<li>immediately call a health care professional or <a
									href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">public
									health authority</a> to discuss your symptoms and travel history, and follow their instructions
								carefully</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You can also use the <a href="https://ca.thrive.health/covid19/en" rel="external">online self-assessment
								tool</a> (if available in your province or territory) to determine if you need further assessment or
							testing for COVID-19. </p>
						<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are living with a person who is isolated because they have or are suspected
							to have COVID-19, your self-isolation period may be extended beyond 14 days. Seek direction from your <a

								health authority</a>. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="clearfix"></div>
					<p>To quarantine (self-isolate), take the following measures: </p>
					<h2>Limit contact with others</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Stay at home or the place you are staying in Canada (do not leave your property).</li>
						<li>Only leave your home for medically necessary appointments (use private transportation for this purpose).
						</li>
						<li>Do not go to school, work, other public areas or use public transportation (e.g., buses, taxis).</li>
						<li>Do not have visitors.&nbsp; </li>
						<li>Avoid contact with older adults, or those with medical conditions, who are at a higher risk of developing
							serious illness. </li>
						<li>Avoid contact with others, especially those who have not travelled or been exposed to the virus. </li>
						<li>If contact cannot be avoided, take the following precautions:
							<ul>
								<li>keep at least 2 metres between yourself and the other person</li>
								<li>keep interactions brief</li>
								<li>stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom, if possible</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#wm">non-medical
								mask or face covering</a> (i.e., <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html">constructed</a>
							to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) if
							close contact with others cannot be avoided, can help protect those around you.</li>
						<li>Avoid contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their
							pets.</li>

					<h2>Keep your hands clean </h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a
								href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html">Wash
								your hands</a> <strong>often</strong> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and dry with disposable
							paper towels or dry reusable towel, replacing it when it becomes wet.</li>
						<li>You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
						<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. </li>
						<li>Cough or sneeze into the bend of your arm or into a tissue. </li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Keep surfaces clean and avoid sharing personal items </h2>
					<ul>
						<li>At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch often, like toilets, bedside tables,
							doorknobs, phones and television remotes. </li>
						<li>To disinfect, use only <a
								href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19.html">approved hard-surface
								disinfectants</a> that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health
							Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.</li>
						<li>When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach
							solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres
							(mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach
							containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for <a
								href="https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/bleach.html" rel="external">proper handling of household
								(chlorine) bleach</a>.</li>
						<li>If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g., keyboards,
							touch screens) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol at least daily.</li>
						<li>Do not share personal items with others, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, non-medical masks or
							face coverings, utensils or electronic devices. </li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Monitor yourself for symptoms</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Monitor yourself for <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#s">symptoms</a>,
							particularly fever and respiratory symptoms such as coughing or difficulty breathing.</li>
						<li>Take and record your temperature daily (or as directed by your <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">public
								health authority</a>) and avoid using fever-reducing medications (e.g. acetaminophen, ibuprofen) as much
							as possible. These medications could mask an early symptom of COVID-19. </li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Supplies to have at home when in quarantine (self-isolation)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a
								href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#wm">Non-medical

					<h3>* Quarantine Act</h3>
					<p>The Government of Canada has implemented an Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act that requires persons
						entering Canada—whether by air, sea or land—to quarantine (self-isolate) themselves for 14 days if they are
						asymptomatic in order to limit the introduction and spread of COVID-19. The 14-day period begins on the day
						the person enters Canada.</p>
					<h3>Work-related travel for essential workers</h3>
					<p>Certain persons who cross the border regularly to ensure the continued flow of goods and <a
							href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/preventing-covid-19-workplace-employers-employees-essential-service-workers.html#_Work-related_travel_for">essential
							services</a>, or individuals who receive or provide other essential services to Canadians, are exempt from
						needing to quarantine (self-isolate) due to travel outside of Canada, as long as they are asymptomatic (do not
						have symptoms of COVID-19). </p>
					<p><strong>They must:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>practise <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">physical
								(social) distancing</a></li>
						<li>self-monitor for <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html?topic=tilelink">symptoms</a>
							(if you develop a symptom, follow the instructions of your local <a
								href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">public
								health authority</a>)</li>
						<li>stay in your place of residence as much as possible. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you have been instructed by public health to quarantine for any other reason (for example, you have been
						in close contact with a case), inform your local public health authority of your status as an essential worker
						and follow their directions.</p>
					<p>We can all do our part in preventing the spread of COVID-19.</p>
