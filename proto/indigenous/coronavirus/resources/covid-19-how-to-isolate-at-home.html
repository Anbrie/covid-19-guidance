			<h2>Limit contact with others</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not leave home unless it’s to seek medical care.</li>
				<li>Do not use public transportation (e.g. buses, taxis).</li>
				<li>Arrange to have groceries and supplies dropped off at your door to minimize contact.</li>
				<li>Stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom from others in your home, if possible.</li>
				<li>If you have to be in contact with others, practise <a
						href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">physical
						distancing</a> and keep at least 2 metres between yourself and the other person. </li>
				<li>Avoid contact with individuals with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and older adults.</li>
				<li>Keep any interactions brief and wear a medical mask if available, or if not available, a <a
