	<h2 id="s">COVID-19 symptoms</h2>
	<p>Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19
		because they are similar to a cold or flu.</p>
	<p>Symptoms have included:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>cough</li>
		<li>fever</li>
		<li>difficulty breathing</li>
		<li>pneumonia in both lungs</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In severe cases, infection can lead to death. </p>
	<p>Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for
		this disease. </p>
	<p>Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing
		symptoms. This includes people who: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)</li>
		<li>never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical
		settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven <a
			href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p">preventative
			measures</a>. </p>

	   <h2 id="wtdsick">If you are sick</h2>

                    <p>If you are experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing you should:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others
                  <li>Visit a health care professional or <a
				href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/indigenous/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">public
			  health authority</a></li> 
		  <li>Call your nursing station or local health facility (when in an Indigenous community). <a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/indigenous/cvd-communities/contact.html">Regional medical officers</a> can answer your health related questions</li>

			<p>If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer</li>
		<li>advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick
			with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms</li>
		<ul>
			<li>this is required under the&nbsp;<em>Quarantine Act</em></li>
			<li>the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
               <h2 id="wtdcare">How to care for someone sick</h2>
               <p>If you are caring for a person who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, follow this advice to protect yourself and others in the home, as well as those in your community. Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without
		needing hospitalization. </p>

               <p> Even if you are not showing symptoms of the coronavirus, you need to quarantine for 14 days if any of the following apply:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>you are returning to your community after being away for an extended period</li>
                  <li>you had close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19</li>
                  <li>you have been told by the  local health facility or the public health authority that you may have been exposed and need to quarantine</li>

	<h3>Check if you have been exposed</h3>

	<p>Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed <a
			href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice/exposure-flights-cruise-ships-mass-gatherings.html">exposure
			locations</a> to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.</p>

	<h3>Take care of your mental health</h3>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of
		control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your <a
			href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/taking-care-mental-health.html">mental and
			physical wellbeing</a> and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed. </p>


	<h2 id="d">Diagnosing coronavirus</h2>
	<p>Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory
		tests.</p>

		<p><a href="https://ca.thrive.health/covid19/en">Find out if you need to be tested</a></p>
	<h2 id="t">Treating coronavirus</h2>
	<p>Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.</p>
	<p>If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may
		recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.</p>
	<h3 id="vaccine">Vaccine</h3>
	<p>If you have received a flu vaccine, it will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;protect against coronaviruses. </p>
	<p>At this time, a vaccine or therapy to treat or prevent this disease has not yet been developed. However, the COVID-19
		pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.</p>

	<h2 id="a">About coronaviruses</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus.html">Coronaviruses</a> are a large family of viruses. Some
		cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically
		associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.</p>
	<p>COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect
		people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.</p>
	<p>There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe
		illness in humans. These are the:</p>
