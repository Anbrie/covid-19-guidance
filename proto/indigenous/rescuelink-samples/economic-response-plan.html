This includes permitting lenders to defer up to six monthly mortgage payments (interest and principal) for impacted borrowers. Canadians who are impacted by COVID-19 and experiencing financial hardship as a result should contact their financial institution regarding flexibility for a mortgage deferral. This gives flexibility to be available − when needed − to those who need it the most. You are encouraged to visit your bank's website for the latest information, rather than calling or visiting a branch.</p>

                <p id="wage_subsidies">The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) supports employers that are hardest hit by the pandemic, and protect the jobs Canadians depend on.</p>
                <p>The subsidy covers 75% of an employee's wages – up to $847 per week - for employers of all sizes and across all sectors who have suffered a drop in gross revenues of at least 15% in March, and 30% in April and May.</p>
                <p>The program will be in place for a 12-week period, from March 15 to June 6, 2020.</p>
                <p>Employers eligible for the CEWS are entitled to receive a 100% refund for certain employer contributions to Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, and the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan paid in respect of employees who are on leave with pay.
                  For employers that are eligible for both the CEWS and the 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy for a period, any benefit from the <a href="#temporary_10_wage_subsidy">Temporary 10%  Wage Subsidy</a> for remuneration paid in a specific period will generally reduce the amount available to be claimed under the CEWS in that same period.</p>
