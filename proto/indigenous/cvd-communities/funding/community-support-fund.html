               <h2 id="a">About the fund</h2>
               <p>The health, safety and well-being of all people in Canada, including First Nations, Inuit and Métis, is and
                  will remain a top priority for all. </p>
               <p>Canada recognizes that First Nation, Inuit and Métis are among the most vulnerable, and that during this
                  crisis, in particular, those in remote and fly-in only parts of the country are uniquely vulnerable.
                  Communities are incredibly resilient and full of solutions and innovative ideas. This is why we must support
                  distinctions-based measures to improve public health response for Indigenous communities and provide them with
                  the flexibility they need to address the specific needs identified by communities and their members.</p>
               <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2020, the Government of Canada announced the
                  COVID-19 Economic Response Plan. This plan includes $305&nbsp;million for a new, distinctions-based Indigenous
                  Community Support Fund to address immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. A portion of
                  these funds will be set aside to support to regional, urban and off-reserve Indigenous organizations.</p>
               <p>These new funds will provide Indigenous leadership with the flexibility needed to design and implement
                  community-based solutions to prepare for and react to the spread of COVID-19 within their communities. These
                  funds could be used for measures including, but not limited to:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>support for Elders and vulnerable community members</li>
                  <li>measures to address food insecurity </li>
                  <li>educational and other support for children</li>
                  <li>mental health assistance and emergency response services</li>
                  <li>preparedness measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19</li>
               </ul>
