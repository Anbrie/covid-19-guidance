               <p>ISC has been:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>training healthcare providers in the use of PPE required to provide safe care in any public health risk
                     situation</li>
                  <li>actively supporting First Nations communities to ensure pandemic plans are current and follow best practices
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>ISC has contacted regions to review the processes in place in order to refill and restock PPE as required.</p>
               <p>ISC has also prepared and shared:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1583781906998/1583781926813">public service announcements</a> about COVID-19 for radio broadcast
                     in 20 Indigenous languages</li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1584456952392/1584456999460">ISC's preparedness and response to COVID-19</a></li>
               </ul>

               <p>As of April 22, ISC has organized charter flights:</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>so that health and infrastructure professionals can serve fly-in First Nations communities south of 60</li>
                  <li>to provide medical supplies</li>
                  <li>to provide equipment required to maintain critical infrastructure such as water treatment plants</li>
               </ul>

               <p>North of 60, CIRNAC is working with Transport Canada and territorial governments to ensure continuity of routes
                  for goods and essential services.</p>
                  
               <p>ISC works closely with PHAC, other Government of Canada departments, and provincial and territorial governments as
                  well as Indigenous partners to protect the health and safety of Indigenous peoples. This includes supporting
                  Indigenous partners in responding to public health threats.</p>

               <p>ISC's network of regional health emergency management coordinators, regional communicable disease nurses and
                  regional medical officers advises and supports First Nation communities and leads public health emergency
                  preparedness and responses as needed.</p>

               <p>ISC directly employs public health and primary care nurses across many First Nations communities. Environmental
                  public health officers also play an important role in health emergency management.</p>

               <p>ISC's network of regional health emergency management coordinators, communicable disease nurses, environmental
                  public health officers and medical officers advises and supports First Nation communities and leads on public
                  health emergency preparedness and response south of 60. ISC funds or directly employs public health, home care and
                  primary care nurses across many First Nation communities.</p>

               <p>In the territories, primary health care is the responsibility of the territorial governments. ISC is working
                  closely with First Nations and Inuit partners and territorial governments to prepare for, and respond to COVID-19,
                  and will be available to provide surge capacity support in a timely manner if needed.</p>
               <p>When it comes to preparedness and response in Métis communities, the primary guidance and support comes from the
                  provincial government.</p>
