<h2 id="#provincial">Resources by province or territory</h2>

<!--
<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many provinces and territories required workplaces/businesses to close, except those providing essential services and goods. <strong>Refer to your <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">provincial or territorial website</a> for the list of essential services and updates on the restriction of non-essential services</strong>. As provinces and territories lift or adjust restrictive public health measures, workplaces/businesses should consider risks and identify risk mitigation measures to implement when re-opening or operating during the COVID-19 pandemic.
-->

<p>Use this guidance along with relevant provincial/territorial health authority recommendations as you reopen or operate.</p>

<!--
<p>Public health measures taken by workplaces/businesses are part of Canada's collective approach to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This tool is based on concepts outlined in the guidance developed for community-based measures titled: <strong>Community-Based Measures to Reduce the Spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Canada</strong>. It reflects the currently available scientific evidence and expert opinion, and is subject to change as new information on transmissibility, epidemiology, and effectiveness of public health and risk mitigation measures becomes available. Employers should review and revise business continuity plans as needed, prioritize key functions in the event of workplace absenteeism, and ensure emergency contact information is up-to-date.</p>-->

<h2 id="recognize">Types of risks in the workplace</h2>

<!--
<p>The following facts about COVID-19 and associated questions can help you consider the risks of COVID-19 in your workplace.</p>
<p>The risk level is affected by the level of COVID-19 activity in the local community. If there is known COVID-19 activity in your community, the likelihood that it could be introduced into the workplace is higher. The risk of COVID-19 introduction and spread is also presumed to be greater if a higher proportion of individuals visit the workplace from outside of your community.</p>-->
<h3>Close interactions</h3>
<p>COVID-19 most commonly spreads through respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing, laughing or talking) during close interactions (within 2 metres). COVID-19 can be spread by infected individuals who have mild symptoms, or who have not yet or who may never develop symptoms.</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Do employees have close interactions with clients or other employees throughout their shift? Do clients have close interactions with other clients? Workplaces/businesses with a higher number of contacts are presumed to have greater risk.</li>
  <li>Do employees have prolonged close interactions with clients or other employees? Do clients have prolonged close interactions with other clients? Prolonged contact is defined as lasting for more than 15 minutes<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup>, and may be cumulative (that is, over multiple interactions). Person-to-person spread is more likely with prolonged contact.</li>
  <li>Is the business/workplace crowded (that is, high density of people) on a regular basis? A crowded setting is presumed to have greater risk.</li>
  <li>Is the workplace indoors or outdoors? If indoors, can windows be opened? A confined indoor space is presumed to have greater risk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Touching something with the virus on it</h3>
<p>COVID-19 can also be spread through touching something with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands.</p>

<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Do employees frequently have contact with high-touch surfaces (that is, frequently touched by others)? &nbsp;Do clients frequently have contact with high-touch surfaces? A higher frequency of contact with high-touch surfaces (for example, door handles, service counters, card payment machines) is presumed to have greater risk.</li>
  <li>Does the set-up of your workplace enable employees/clients to wash and/or sanitize their hands before and after contact with high-touch surfaces (for example, access to hand hygiene stations/supplies)?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Employees and clients in higher risk groups</h3>
<p>COVID-19 can cause more severe illness among people who are 65 and over, and those who have compromised immune systems or other underlying medical conditions.</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Are you aware whether your employees belong to any of these higher risk groups? <strong>NOTE: Employers cannot assume they know the health status of individual employees and are not necessarily entitled to this information. Employees may choose to confidentially disclose health status to employers and accommodations can be made accordingly.</strong></li>
  <li>Do you have clients who are at higher risk of severe illness (for example, older adults)?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Poor hygiene practices</h3>
<p>COVID-19 spread can occur when personal preventive practices are not consistently followed.</p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Are your clients able to follow hygiene practices such as washing hands frequently, respiratory etiquette, and identifying when they are feeling ill and staying home? For example, young children are less likely to be able to carry out these practices.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reduce">Reducing risks in the workplace</h2>

<!--
<p>To prevent and/or limit the spread of COVID-19 in community-based settings such as your workplace, consider the following risk mitigation principles and measures. Risk mitigation measures that are more protective involve separating people from each other or shared surfaces through physical distancing and physical barriers. Measures that are less protective rely on individuals to consistently follow personal preventive practices (for example, environmental cleaning, use of personal protective equipment, wearing of <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html">non-medical masks or cloth face coverings</a>). In some settings, physical distancing or separation may not be possible. To maximize safety, use a “layered” approach with multiple measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, including decreasing the number of interactions with others and increasing the safety of interactions. Layering of multiple mitigation measures strengthens the risk mitigation potential overall.
-->

<p>The following examples of risk mitigation measures is not exhaustive – you are encouraged to find creative and adaptive ways to reduce risk in your workplace setting that align with public health advice and are respectful of workers.</p>
<p><strong>Discourage people who are ill from entering the workplace.</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Strengthen communication strategies for employees, clients, customers</li>
  <li>Require that employees stay at home if ill with <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#s">symptoms of COVID-19</a> until criteria to discontinue isolation<sup id="fn2-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn2"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>2</a></sup> have been met, in consultation with the local public health authority or healthcare provider</li>
  <li>Adjust personal/sick leave policies to enable employees to stay home when ill, undergoing COVID-19 testing, in quarantine (self-isolation), or if they are taking care of children or someone who is ill</li>
  <li>Post accessible signage to discourage employees/clients who are ill from entering the workplace setting</li>
  <li>If feasible, consider asking clients if they are ill or have symptoms of COVID-19 before they enter the workplace setting or when making appointments, and ask clients who are ill to not attend the workplace</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Promote and facilitate personal preventive practices. Everyone plays a part in making workplaces/businesses safer, including employers, employees, contractors, clients, and all others who interact with workplaces/businesses.</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Keep your employees informed about public health advice applicable to your workplace</li>
  <li>Promote the use of personal practices (for example, frequent <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html">hand hygiene</a>, avoid touching the face, respiratory etiquette, <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/cleaning-disinfecting-public-spaces.html">clean and disinfect</a> frequently touched surfaces with <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19.html">approved products</a>)</li>
  <ul class="lst-spcd">
    <li>Post signage that reminds employees/clients to practice these measures, ensuring that it is appropriate for the employees'/clients' age, ability, reading level and language preferences</li>
    <li>Provide increased access to hand hygiene facilities (for example by placing hand sanitizer dispensers in easy to see locations) and ensure accessibility for employees/clients with disabilities or other accommodation needs</li>
    <li>Promote increased environmental cleaning of employees' work environments (for example, provide sanitizing wipes so employees can clean their own workstations)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Support and encourage employees to <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/mental-health.html">take care of their mental health</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Promote <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">physical distancing</a> (keeping a distance of 2 metres from others), which is one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness.</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>If possible, reduce all physical contact by enabling telework (for example, work from home, use of email and teleconferencing)</li>
  <li>Adopt a contact-less business model (for example, drive-through, delivery, curbside pickup)</li>
  <li>Establish 2 metre separation between employees and/or clients (for example, desks, workstations, restaurant tables, or in meeting rooms)</li>
  <li>Avoid multi-person meetings by using video conferencing technology where possible</li>
  <li>Restrict occupant capacity of indoor spaces to reduce crowding</li>
  <li>In narrow hallways or aisles, encourage unidirectional travel where possible</li>
  <li>Use visual cues to encourage 2 metre distance (for example, accessible signage, floor markings)</li>
  <li>Reinforce general practices to maintain physical distancing, such as avoiding greetings like handshakes</li>
  <li>Identify a space where employees or clients can be isolated from others if they develop symptoms and are not able to leave the facility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Create physical barriers between employees/clients when physical distancing is not possible.</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Install physical separations between employees/clients (for example physical barriers like a plexiglass window or cubicle higher than head-height)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increase ventilation.</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Open windows if possible and, if weather permits<sup id="fn3-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn3"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Move work outside when possible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reduce risks from exposure to high-touch surfaces (that is, frequently touched by others).</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Increase frequency of <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/cleaning-disinfecting-public-spaces.html">environmental cleaning</a>, especially of high touch surfaces or equipment (for example, shared photocopier, elevator buttons, cash register, washrooms)</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of common surfaces that need to be touched (for example, prop doors open, no-touch waste containers)</li>
  <li>Restrict access to non-essential shared equipment</li>
  <li>Clean and disinfect essential shared equipment before and after use</li>
  <li>Offer contactless payment methods (that is, minimize use of cash), if possible<sup id="fn4-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn4"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reduce risk for people at higher risk of severe illness.</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Provide equitable workplace accommodations (for example, role/task reassignment), if possible, for employees who have risk factors for severe disease</li>
  <li>Provide special accommodations for clients from vulnerable groups (for example, dedicated shopping hours for seniors)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Modify practices to reduce how long employees/clients are in contact with each other and how many employees/clients come into contact with each other.</strong></p>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Consider modifying service delivery (for example, reducing the number of clients using services at the same time, providing services outdoors)</li>
  <li>Close or restrict access to non-essential common areas</li>
  <li>Stagger work hours or work days to reduce number of contacts</li>
  <li>Postpone non-essential meetings or travel</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="masks">Masks and personal protective equipment</h2>


  <p>Wearing non-medical masks (<abbr>NMM</abbr>s) or cloth face coverings is an additional personal practice that can help prevent the infectious respiratory droplets of an unknowingly-infected person from coming into contact with other people.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html">Appropriate use of non-medical masks or face coverings</a></li>
  	<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/video/covid-19-wear-non-medical-mask-face-covering-properly.html">Video: How to wear a non-medical mask or face covering properly</a> (1 minute 25 seconds)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When the local epidemiology and rate of community transmission warrant it, <strong>wearing of <abbr>NMM</abbr>s or cloth face coverings is recommended </strong>for periods of time when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2 metre physical distance from others, particularly in crowded settings.</p>
  <p>Commercially available or homemade cloth masks or face coverings can play an important role in workplaces/businesses where consistent physical distancing or the use of physical barriers or other modification to the work environment or work flow are not possible or available.</p>
  <p>It is important that non-medical masks or cloth face coverings fit well and are worn safely.</p>
  <p>Masks may not be suitable for all types of occupation. When establishing policies regarding use of <abbr>NMM</abbr>s or cloth face coverings at your workplace, consider carefully the occupational requirements of your employees and the specific configuration of your workplace to ensure mitigation against any possible physical injuries that might inadvertently be caused by wearing a face covering (for example, interfering with the ability to see or speak clearly, or becoming accidentally lodged in equipment the wearer is operating). Consider the potential psychological impacts of <abbr>NMM</abbr>s or cloth face coverings on other employees or clients (for example, design/construction of the mask, messaging, etc.).</p>
  <p><abbr>NMM</abbr>s are not considered personal protective equipment (<abbr>PPE</abbr>). Although all efforts should be made to preserve the supply of medical masks for healthcare settings, there may be some workplace settings for which <abbr>PPE</abbr> (for example, medical masks) may be a more appropriate choice for the protection of the worker (for example, providing services to a client who cannot wear a NMM or face covering when the 2 metre physical distance cannot be maintained, or measures such as plexiglass/transparent barriers are not possible or available).</p>



<h3>Should employees wear personal protective equipment (<abbr>PPE</abbr>)?</h3>

<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Recommendations for the use of <abbr>PPE</abbr><sup id="fn5-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn5"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>5</a></sup> are based on risk assessments of specific environments and risk of exposure. If your workplace has a joint occupational health and safety (<abbr>OHS</abbr>) committee (or representative, for small businesses), involve the <abbr>OHS</abbr> committee when considering risks associated with specific tasks/activities as well as the characteristics of the source of the infection (for example, a person who is ill or a contaminated environment). If your workplace does not have an <abbr>OHS</abbr> committee, refer to guidance provided by your provincial/territorial occupational health organizations.</li>
  <li>If <abbr>PPE</abbr> is recommended, employees must be trained on the appropriate use of <abbr>PPE</abbr> and the sequence for putting it on (donning) and taking it off (doffing). Employees should also be trained about proper fit and provided with different sizes of <abbr>PPE</abbr> to account for anatomical differences, for example between women and men. Misuse of <abbr>PPE</abbr> can increase the risk of infection (for example, through contact with potentially contaminated <abbr>PPE</abbr>).</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="emerge">Emergency preparedness and response</h2>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Consider how emergency preparedness (for example building evacuation plans) are impacted by COVID-19 public health measures.</li>
  <li>Ensure that COVID-19 measures do not introduce new occupational hazards to the work setting (for example, do not prop open fire doors to reduce exposure to frequently touched door handles)</li>
  <li>Communicate with employees about how to respond to emergencies as safely as possible while COVID-19 measures are in place.</li>
