			<p>You can deduct expenses you paid in 2019 for the employment use of a work space in your home, as long as you had to pay for them under your contract of employment. These expenses must be used directly in your work and your employer has not reimbursed and will not reimburse you. Also, you must meet <strong>one of the following conditions</strong>:</p>

<p>Because Kumi principally (more than 50% of the time) worked from home during a continuous period of nine weeks in 2020, she may be able to deduct work-space-in-the-home expenses paid in that period if the other conditions are met.</p>

<p>Emma’s employer required her to work from home from April to October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because Emma principally (more than 50% of the time) worked from home during a continuous period of 31 weeks in 2020, she may be able to deduct work-space-in-the-home expenses paid in that period if the other conditions are met.</p>

<p>Chiu’s employer required him to work from home some of the time from April to August in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, Chiu worked on an alternating schedule of two days from home and three days from his employer’s office one week, and three days from home and two days from his employer’s office the following week.

<p>Because Chiu did not principally (more than 50% of the time) work from home during that continuous period of 22 weeks in 2020 (i.e., he worked from home only 50% of the time during the period), he cannot deduct work-space-in-the-home expenses paid in that period.</p>
