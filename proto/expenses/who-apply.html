                     <p>Isaac’s employer required him to work from home for three weeks beginning in mid-March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During these three weeks, he worked exclusively from home and performed all of the duties that he normally performed at his employer’s office. Following this three-week period, Isaac returned to his employer’s office for the rest of 2020 to perform all of his employment duties. </p>

                     <p>Because Isaac was not required to work from home for a reasonably significant period in 2020 (i.e., his employer required him to work from home for a continuous period of only three weeks), he cannot deduct work-space-in-the-home expenses paid in that period.</p>
