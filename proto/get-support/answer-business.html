    <h2>Payroll payments reduced by 10%</h2>
    <p>To support businesses that are facing revenue losses and to help prevent lay-offs, the government is proposing to provide eligible small employers a temporary wage subsidy for a period of three months. The subsidy will be equal to 10% of remuneration paid during that period, up to a maximum subsidy of $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer. Businesses will be able to benefit immediately from this support by reducing their remittances of income tax withheld on/ their employees’ remuneration. Employers benefiting from this measure will include corporations eligible for the small business deduction, as well as non-profit organizations and charities.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Business tax payments deferred until after August 31, 2020</h2>
    <p>The Canada Revenue Agency will allow all businesses to defer,  until after August 31, 2020, the payment of any income tax amounts that become  owing on or after today and before September 2020.&nbsp; This relief would  apply to tax balances due, as well as instalments, under Part I of the&nbsp;<em>Income  Tax Act</em>. No interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during  this period.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Canada Revenue Agency will not contact any small or medium  (SME) businesses to initiate any post assessment GST/HST or Income Tax audits  for the next four weeks. For the vast majority of businesses, the Canada  Revenue Agency will temporarily suspend audit interaction with taxpayers and  representatives.</p>
    <p>The Liaison Officer service offers help to owners of small  businesses to understand their tax obligations. Traditionally available  in-person, this service is now available over the phone and will be customizing  information during these challenging times by ensuring small businesses are  aware of any changes such as filing and payment deadlines, proactive relief  measures, etc.</p>

    <h2>Lower interest rate and domestic stability buffer</h2>
    <p>The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) announced it is lowering the Domestic Stability Buffer by 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, effective immediately. This action will allow Canada’s large banks to inject $300 billion of additional lending in to the economy.</p>
    <p>The Bank of Canada also took a series of actions to support the Canadian economy during this period of economic stress, enhance the resilience of the Canadian financial system, and help ensure that financial institutions can continue to extend credit to both households and businesses. This included cutting the interest rate to 0.75% as a proactive measure in light of the negative shocks to Canada’s economy arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent sharp drop in oil prices.</p>
