    <h2 id="h-2">What is an eligible revenue reduction</h2>
    <p>You must determine if your reduced revenue makes you eligible to apply for the wage subsidy in a particular period.</p>
<p>If you qualify for the CEWS for one claim period, you will automatically qualify for the following claim period.</p>
    <p>Calculate your reduction by comparing your eligible revenue for the starting month of the claim period with your baseline revenue. Your baseline revenue is the amount you earned in either:
<ul>
<li>the corresponding month in 2019, or</li>
<li>the average of January and February, 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>The method of comparison you choose must be the same for each period.</p>

    <h3>Eligible revenue</h3>
<p>Eligible revenue generally includes revenue earned in Canada from:
<ul>
<li>selling goods</li>
<li>rendering services, and</li>
<li>others' use of your resources</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Registered charities and non-profit organizations may choose whether or not to include revenue from government sources, such as grants, when applying for the subsidy. You must take the same approach for each period you are applying for.</p>

<p>Use your normal accounting method when calculating revenue. You can use the cash method or the accrual method, but you must use the same approach throughout.</p>

<p>There are special rules for revenue related to certain non-arm's-length transactions and affiliated groups.</p>

<!--<p><a href="link TBD">Read more about how revenue is calculated</a></p>-->

    <h3>Examples of revenue reduction calculation</h3>
<!--    <details>
      <summary>Example 1: Employer began operations in January 2020</summary>
<p>An eligible employer is determining if it has experienced the required reduction in revenue to qualify in order to claim the CEWS for the first claim period, from March 15 to April 11, 2020. Since the eligible employer only began operations on January, 14, 2020, it must use the alternative approach to determine its reduction in revenue. Its total qualifying revenues earned in January and February 2020 was $90,000. Its average qualifying revenue for the two months will be $57,447 [0.5x90,000x(60/47]. Its qualifying revenue for March 2020 is $39,600.</p>

<p>Because its qualifying revenue for March 2020 has declined by 31 % when compared to the average of its qualifying revenues earned in both January and February 2020, the eligible employer has experienced the required reduction in revenue of at least 15 per cent for the first claim period and will qualify to claim the CEWS for that period.</p>

<p>Because it has qualified for the first claim period, the eligible employer is automatically considered to have experienced the required reduction in revenue for the second claim period (April 12 to May 9, 2020) and need not make this determination again when claiming the CEWS for that next claim period.</p>

</details>-->

   <!-- <details>
      <summary>Example 2: Employer automatically qualifies </summary>
<p>An eligible employer is determining if it has experienced the required reduction in revenue to qualify in order to claim the CEWS for the first claim period, from March 15 to April 11, 2020. The eligible employer is using the general year-over-year approach to determine its reduction in revenue. Its qualifying revenues for March 2019 were $250,000 and its qualifying revenues for March 2020 are $180,000.</p>

<p>Because its qualifying revenue for March 2020 has declined by 28% when compared to its qualifying revenue for March 2019, the eligible employer has experienced the required reduction in revenue of at least 15 per cent for the first claim period and may qualify to claim the CEWS for that period.</p>

<p>Because it has qualified for the first claim period, the eligible employer is automatically considered to have experienced the required reduction in revenue for the second claim period (April 12 to May 9) and does not need to make the determination again when claiming the CEWS for that next claim period. For clarity, it will be deemed to have met the 30% test for the second period.</p>

     <h2 id="h-3">Who are eligible employees</h2>
   
        <p>An eligible employee is an individual employed in Canada by you (the eligible employer) during the claim period, <strong>except</strong> if there was a period of 14 or more consecutive days in that period where they did not receive any pay (eligible remuneration).</p>

<p>Employee eligibility is based on where the person is employed, not where they live.</p>

<p>Employees who have been laid off or furloughed can become eligible retroactively, as long as you re-hire them and their retroactive pay and status meet the eligibility criteria for the claim period. You must rehire pay such employees before you include them in your calculation for the subsidy.</p>

      <summary>Part-time staff, retroactive hiring, and CERB payments</summary>
      <h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Carl, as a sole proprietor, owns a corner store in London, Ontario, where he normally employs Molly on a full-time basis and two other employees on a part time basis. Carl had laid off all his employees on March 15, 2020, due to a decreased demand for his shop’s goods and services. However, following the announcement of the CEWS, Carl has determined that he is an eligible employer and decided to re-hire Molly, effective April 5, 2020. He also hires a new employee, Paul, on April 12th. Paul was laid off by his previous employer due to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Even though Molly was employed for a week in the first claim period (March 15, 2020, to April 11, 2020), she is not an eligible employee in that period because she was without remuneration from Carl for more than 14 consecutive days (21 days - March 15, 2020, to April 4, 2020). However, she may be an eligible employee in the following claim period (April 12-May 9, 2020), assuming Carl keeps Molly on his payroll and continues to pay her.</p>
<p>If Carl had instead chosen to rehire and pay Molly retroactively to March 15, 2020, she would have qualified as an eligible employee for the first claim period. In this scenario, Carl would have been eligible to claim the CEWS for the first claim period, in respect of the eligible remuneration paid to Molly.</p>
<p>Paul receives eligible remuneration starting April 12th. Assuming Paul receives eligible remuneration for 14 or more consecutive days in the second claim period (April 12, 2020 - May 9, 2020), Paul would qualify as an eligible employee and Carl would be eligible to claim the CEWS with respect to the eligible remuneration paid to Paul, for the second claim period.</p>
<p>Now assume that both Paul and Molly received CERB payments during the time they were laid off, and Paul continued to receive CERB payments after he was hired.  Carl’s eligibility for the CEWS will not change because of the CERB payments to Molly and Paul. However, it is Paul and Molly’s responsibility to determine their eligibility for the CERB for any period. If they have received a CERB payment and they are no longer eligible, they have the ability to return or repay the CERB payment.</p>

<!--
<h3>Eligible employees and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)</h3>
<p>The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) is a benefit for people who were <strong>unpaid</strong> for 14 or more consecutive days within a claim period, while the wage subsidy (CEWS) concerns employees who were <strong>paid</strong> for 14 or more days within the claim period, even retroactively. The eligibility for these two programs should not overlap.</p>
<p>If you re-hire employees who previously received the CERB for the same claim period, the employee may be asked to cancel their claim and repay the amount of CERB they received.</p>-->

      <h2 id="h-4">What is eligible remuneration</h2>
        <p>Eligible remuneration includes amounts received you paid an employee as salary, wages and other taxable benefits, fees and commissions. These are amounts employers would be required to make payroll deductions on to be remitted to the CRA. </p>
        <p>Severance pay and items such as stock option benefits or the personal use of a corporate vehicle are <b>not</b> part of eligible remuneration.</p>

<p>When calculating the wage subsidy, you will need to determine an employee's baseline remuneration. Baseline remuneration is considered to be the average weekly eligible remuneration paid to an employee during the period of January 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. However, you may exclude from your calculation any period of seven or more consecutive days for which the employee was not paid.</p>
