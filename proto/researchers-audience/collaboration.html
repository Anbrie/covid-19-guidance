	<p>The <a href="/en/public-health/services/emergency-preparedness/public-health-response-plan-biological-events.html">Federal/Provincial/Territorial Public Health Response Plan for Biological Events</a> has been activated to ensure a coordinated response across Canada.</p>
	<p>A special advisory committee has been established to advise the Deputy Ministers of Health on the coordination, public health policy and technical content related to this outbreak. This committee consists of the members of the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network Council and the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health.</p>
	<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is working closely with partners domestically and around the world, including the World Health Organization (<abbr>WHO</abbr>), to respond to this outbreak.</p>
	<p>Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (<abbr>NML</abbr>) has developed a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (<abbr>rRT-PCR</abbr>) test that can diagnose COVID-19 from clinical specimens. The <abbr title="National Microbiology Laboratory">NML</abbr> is working collaboratively with Canadian provincial public health laboratories to ensure there is additional testing capacity in multiple jurisdictions.</p>
	<p>At this time, the <abbr title="National Microbiology Laboratory">NML</abbr> also supports the use of other international assays that have been posted publicly.</p>
	<p>Further collaborative scientific studies to investigate the virus are underway.</p>
	<p>The Government of Canada is working with international regulators to help fast-track clinical trials and applications for vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests. The International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities held a global medicines regulators web meeting on March 18, 2020. Discussions included regulatory considerations for anticipated COVID-19 vaccine candidates to advance regulatory convergence. A key objective of the meeting was to discuss and agree on an approach to the requirements to support first-in-human clinical trials. The <a href="http://www.icmra.info/drupal/news/March2020" rel="external">press release</a> and <a href="http://www.icmra.info/drupal/sites/default/files/2020-03/First%20regulatory%20COVID-19%20workshop%20-%20meeting%20report_March%202020.pdf" rel="external">meeting report</a> are available for access. Health Canada has also engaged with international regulatory partners under the Australia-Canada-Singapore-Switzerland Consortium to explore potential collaboration on regulatory issues related to COVID-19.</p>
	<p>We are also working closely with international regulatory partners, including the European Medicines Agency, the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration, to share information on any signals of global supply disruptions.</p>
