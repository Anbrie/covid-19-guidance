  <h2 id="flights">Bans and redirects on air travel</h2>
  <p>As of March 18, 2020, the Government of Canada will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ban foreign nationals from all countries except the United States from entering Canada. This measure does not apply to air crews, travellers arriving in Canada in transit to a third country, Canadian permanent residents, diplomats or immediate family members of Canadian citizens.</li>
    <li>redirect international passenger flight arrivals to 4 airports:
      <ul>
        <li>Calgary International Airport</li>
        <li>Vancouver International Airport</li>
        <li>Toronto-Pearson International Airport</li>
        <li>Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This  measure will not affect domestic flights or flights from the U. S., sun destinations (such as Mexico  and the Caribbean), or St. Pierre-et-Miquelon, which can continue to  operate on their regular routes and land at current Canadian destinations. The  Government is working closely with the airline industry and airports to avoid  unnecessarily disrupting operations and to minimize the inconvenience to travellers.</p>
  <h2 id="airports">Airport health screening</h2>
  <p>Canada  will also implement measures at airports to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>strengthen health screening </li>
    <li>increase presence to conduct further  health screening and public outreach</li>
    <li>increase signage        throughout the arrivals area to encourage travellers to follow the latest        public health guidance</li>
    <li>prevent all        travellers who have COVID-19 symptoms, regardless of their citizenship,        from boarding international flights to Canada 
      <ul>
        <li>airlines will conduct a basic  health assessment of all air travellers based on guidance from the Public  Health Agency of Canada </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
  
<h2 id="self-isolate">Travellers must self-isolate for 14 days</h2>
  <p>As of March 16, 2020, all travellers entering Canada are being asked to <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/self-monitoring-self-isolation-isolation-for-covid-19.html">self-isolate</a> for 14 days upon entry with <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#exemptions">exceptions</a> for workers who are essential to the movement of goods and people. Individuals should avoid contact with other people for 14 days, while monitoring themselves closely for symptoms. </p>
  <p>The following questions are now being asked at  electronic kiosks and by all border services officers at the primary inspection  line at all air, land, ferry and rail ports of entry:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you currently have a cough,  difficulty breathing, or feel you have a fever?</li>
    <li>I acknowledge that I am/we are  being asked to self-isolate for 14 days to prevent the potential spread of  COVID-19.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Border services officers remain vigilant and are  highly trained to identify travellers seeking entry into Canada who may pose a  health and safety risk. All travellers (no matter their country of origin) are  assessed on arrival to Canada. </p>
<p>These measures complement routine traveller screening procedures already in place to detect and respond to the spread of serious infectious diseases into and within Canada.</p>
  <h3 id="when">When showing signs and symptoms of infection</h3>
  <p>As part of our regular  procedures, when a traveller shows signs of an infectious disease upon arrival in Canada, border services officers, or airport and airline staff contact a<abbrev> </abbrev>quarantine officer.</p>
  <p>The quarantine officer then performs a more detailed assessment. If necessary, the quarantine officer will address the potential public health risk, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ordering the traveller to be transported to hospital to undergo a medical examination</li>
    <li>reporting to the local public health authority</li>
  </ul>
