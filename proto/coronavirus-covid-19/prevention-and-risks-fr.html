<h2 id="how">How coronavirus spreads
</h2>
<p>Human coronaviruses cause infections of the nose, throat and lungs.
</p>
<p>They are most commonly spread from an infected person through:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>respiratory droplets when you cough or sneeze</li>
	<li>close contact including touching or shaking hands</li>
	<li>touching something with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands</li>
</ul>
<p>Current evidence suggests person-to-person spread is efficient when there is close contact.
</p>
<p>At this time, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 or any natural health products that are authorized to protect against
	it.

			<summary>Products shipped from China
			</summary>
			<p>Coronaviruses generally do not survive on surfaces after being contaminated. The risk of spread from products
				shipped over a period of days or weeks at room temperature is <strong>very low</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>There is no known risk of coronaviruses entering Canada on parcels or packages coming from affected regions in
				China.
			</p>

			<summary>Animals in Canada
			</summary>
			<p>There is currently no evidence to suggest that this virus is circulating in animals in Canada.
			</p>
			<p>It is possible that some types of animals can be infected with COVID-19 but there is no evidence that pets or
				other animals can spread the virus. There are still many unknowns about COVID-19 and this is an area that
				remains to be studied and understood.
			</p>
			<p>Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>avoid close contact with them
					<ul>
						<li>do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>practise good cough etiquette
					<ul>
						<li>avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>have another member of your household care for your animals
					<ul>
						<li>if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>limit your animal's contact with other people and animals
					<ul>
						<li>this may mean keeping them indoors</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere. However, livestock
				producers should follow normal biosecurity measures as always. This includes limiting visitors or workers who
				may have travelled to, or been in contact with, someone from an affected area. For more information on-farm
				disease prevention, producers are encouraged to consult the:

			<summary>Animals in or from other countries
			</summary>
			<p>Although the current spread and growth of the COVID-19 outbreak is primarily associated with spread from person
				to person, experts agree that the virus likely originated from bats and may have passed through an intermediary
				animal source (currently unknown) in China before being transmitted to humans.
			</p>
			<p>It is recommended that individuals who travel to an affected country or region avoid contact with animals,
				including wild meat and wet (live animal) markets.
			</p>
			<p>If you are considering travel, check the latest travel health notices for the most up-to-date travel advice
				prior to travelling.
			</p>
			<p>All animals entering Canada must meet <a
					href="https://www.inspection.gc.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/imports/import-policies/live-animals/pet-imports/eng/1326600389775/1326600500578">import
					requirements</a> set out by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. There are currently no specific requirements
				in place in Canada restricting animal importation related to the COVID-19 outbreak. This is because as there is
				no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can spread the virus.
			</p>
			<p>However, until we know more, importers, rescue organizations and adoptive families should consider limiting or
				postponing importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>they should be closely monitored for signs of illness</li>
				<li>you should contact a veterinarian if they become sick
					<ul>
						<li>call ahead to ensure they are aware of the circumstances</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
