</ul>
<h2>Why avoid cruise ship travel
</h2>
<p>Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who may be arriving from areas with known or unknown
	spread of COVID-19.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The virus can spread quickly due to the close contact between passengers&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Older people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of
		developing severe disease</li>
	<li>While the majority of affected passengers may experience mild symptoms, there have been a
		<strong>significant</strong> number of cases requiring hospitalization and <strong>critical care</strong>, and some
		deaths have been reported</li>
</ul>
<h2>If you do go on a cruise
</h2>
<h3>Expect increased restrictions
</h3>
<p>Many countries are implementing restrictions to contain the outbreak. These may impact your:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>itinerary</li>
	<li>ability to disembark</li>
	<li>access to health care</li>
</ul>
<h3>If there is a COVID-19 outbreak on your cruise ship
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You could be subject to quarantine procedures, on-board ship or in a foreign country</li>
	<li>The range of consular services available to those on cruise ships, in particular in situations of quarantine, may
		be significantly restricted by local authorities</li>
	<li>Upon return to Canada, you will be required to remain in mandatory isolation for 14 days at a location determined
		by the Chief Public Health Officer as per the terms of any applicable emergency orders</li>
</ul>
<h3>Be prepared to cover the costs of return travel
</h3>
<p>You may not be offered the opportunity to return to Canada on a government-organized repatriation flight, or could be
	responsible for the costs of repatriation travel.
</p>
<p>Government of Canada COVID-19 information line: 1-833-784-4397.
</p>
<h2>For passengers from the <em>MS Westerdam</em> cruise ship
</h2>
<p>Based on recent evidence and what we know about the health of those aboard the MS Westerdam cruise ship, there is no
	indication that passengers were exposed to COVID-19. As a result, Canada's border measures specific to passengers who
	were on the <em>MS Westerdam</em> have been changed to reflect the reduced risk to public health.
</p>
<p>Upon arrival at a Canadian port of entry, those aboard the ship will now be asked to monitor for symptoms of COVID-19
	(fever, cough and difficulty breathing). If symptoms are present, they should contact their local public health
	authority. They will also receive an information handout on COVID-19.
</p>
<p>Passengers are advised to contact their airlines to determine if they have put in place any travel restrictions.
