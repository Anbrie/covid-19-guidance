<section>
	<h2>	Transmission</h2>


<p>Current epidemiologic information suggests that human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 can occur when an individual is in close contact with a symptomatic case. Human coronaviruses are most commonly spread from an infected person through: respiratory droplets; close, prolonged personal contact; and touching an infected area, then touching mouth, nose or eyes before washing hands.</p>

</section>
  <section>
	<h2 id="control">Infection prevention and control</h2>
	<p>In the absence of effective drugs or vaccines, infection prevention and control (<abbr>IPC</abbr>) strategies to prevent or limit transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>prompt identification</li>
		<li>appropriate risk assessment</li>
		<li>management and placement of probable and  confirmed cases</li>
		<li>investigation and follow up of close contacts</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="early">Early recognition and source control</h3>
	<p>To facilitate early recognition and source control:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>triage for identification and appropriate  placement (source control) of patients</li>
		<li>masks, tissues and alcohol-based hand rubs  (<abbr>AHBR</abbr>) should be available at entrances</li>
		<li>signage should be posted to instruct symptomatic  patients to alert healthcare workers, thus prompting completion of a patient  screening questionnaire</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If a person presents with symptoms of influenza-like illness  and within 14 days before the onset of illness, has travelled outside of Canada, and/or been in close contact with a  probable or confirmed case of COVID-19 or someone who has travelled outside of Canada:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>place the patient in a designated separate  waiting area or space</li>
		<li>encourage the patient with signs and symptoms of  an acute respiratory infection to perform respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette,  and provide tissues, AHBR and a waste receptacle</li>
		<li>limit visitors to only those who are essential</li>
		<li>do <strong>not </strong>cohort  with other patients (unless necessary, in which case cohort only with patients  confirmed to have COVID-19)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="application">Application of routine practices and additional precautions</h3>
	<p>The application of routine practices and additional  precautions (<abbr>RPAP</abbr>) is based on a point-of-care risk assessment (<abbr>PCRA</abbr>). Health  care workers (<abbr>HCW</abbr>s) should use a risk assessment approach before and during  each patient interaction to evaluate the likelihood of exposure.</p>
	<p>In addition to the consistent application of routine practices,  follow contact and droplet precautions. This includes the appropriate selection  and use of <strong>all</strong> the following personal  protective equipment (<abbr>PPE</abbr>):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>gloves</li>
		<li>a long-sleeved gown</li>
		<li>facial protection, such as surgical/procedural  mask and eye protection, face shield, or surgical/procedural mask with visor  attachment</li>
		<li>an N95 respirator (plus eye protection) should  be used when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures (<abbr>AGMP</abbr>s) on a  person under investigation (<abbr>PUI</abbr>) for COVID-19</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Hand hygiene should be performed whenever indicated, paying particular attention to during and after removal of PPE, and after leaving the  patient care environment.</p>
  </section>

<section>
	<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
	<p>There is currently no vaccine against or specific treatment  for COVID-19. Treatment is supportive and should be tailored to the  patient's condition.</p>
	<p>The <abbr>WHO</abbr> has published <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected">guidance on the clinical management of  severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus infection is  suspected</a>.</p>
