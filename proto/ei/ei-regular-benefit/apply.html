				<h2>Changes to support you during COVID-19</h2>
				<p>As of September 27, 2020, there are some temporary changes to the EI program to help you access EI regular
					benefits. The following changes will be in effect for 1 year and could apply to you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A minimum unemployment rate of 13.1% applies to all regions across Canada starting August 9, 2020 <ul>
							<li>If your region’s unemployment rate is higher than 13.1%, we’ll use the higher actual rate to calculate your
								benefits</li>
							<li>This means you can receive at least 26 weeks of regular benefits</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>You only need 120 insured hours to qualify for benefits because you’ll get a one-time credit of 300 insured
						hours to help you meet the required 420 insured hours of work</li>
					<li>You’ll receive at least $500 per week before taxes but you could receive more</li>
					<li>If you received the CERB, the 52-week period to accumulate insured hours will be extended</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Sections on this page impacted by these temporary changes are flagged as <span class="label label-info"><span
							class="h3 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">Temporary COVID-19 relief</span></span>.</p>

				<h2 class="mrgn-tp-0">5. Apply</h2>
				<p> <strong>Please review the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-regular-benefit/eligibility.html">eligibility
							criteria</a> before starting your application.</strong> </p>
				<p>To find out if you are eligible to receive <abbr>EI</abbr> regular benefits, you must submit an application online.
					It will take about 60 minutes to complete the online application.</p>
				<p>The website takes you step by step through the application process, and provides detailed instructions on how to
					complete the form.</p>
				<p>When you apply for Employment Insurance benefits, you will be asked for your email address. If Service Canada needs
					more information about your claim and cannot reach you by phone, a Service Canada agent will send you a toll-free
					number by email, asking you to call an agent.</p>
				<p>If you started a new Employment Insurance (<abbr>EI</abbr>) claim within the last 52 weeks and there are still
					weeks payable on that claim, <strong>we will automatically reactivate (renew) your existing claim when you submit
						your application</strong>.</p>
				<p>In some cases, it may be to your advantage to cancel or end your old claim and start a new claim, because this may
					increase the amount of your benefits or the length of your benefit period.</p>
				<p>You must decide whether or not to cancel or renew a claim based on your own personal situation.</p>
				<p>It is important to consider:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>if your claim is reactivated and you work after the start of that claim, you may be able to establish a new
						claim when your existing claim runs out.</li>
					<li>in order to establish a new claim you must have enough insurable hours and meet the qualifying conditions for a
						new claim. <a href="#covid19-changes" class="label label-info"><span class="h3 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">Temporary
								COVID-19 relief</span></a></li>
					<li>if a new claim is established instead of reactivating your existing claim, the remaining weeks payable on the
						existing claim will be lost.</li>
					<li>additionally, a one-week unpaid waiting period must be served on a new claim before you are entitled to receive
						payment.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Visit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account (MSCA)</a> for
					more information about your previous claim. </p>
				<p>To <strong>get paid as quickly as possible</strong>, take a few minutes to review your direct deposit information
					in MSCA and update it if necessary.</p>
