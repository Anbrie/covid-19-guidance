			<h2>Changes to support you during COVID-19</h2>
			<p>As of September 27, 2020, there are some temporary changes to the EI program to help you access EI regular
				benefits. The following changes will be in effect for 1 year and could apply to you:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A minimum unemployment rate of 13.1% applies to all regions across Canada starting August 9, 2020 <ul>
						<li>If your region’s unemployment rate is higher than 13.1%, we’ll use the higher actual rate to calculate your
							benefits</li>
						<li>This means you can receive at least 26 weeks of regular benefits</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You only need 120 insured hours to qualify for benefits because you’ll get a one-time credit of 300 insured
					hours to help you meet the required 420 insured hours of work</li>
				<li>You’ll receive at least $500 per week before taxes but you could receive more</li>
				<li>If you received the CERB, the 52-week period to accumulate insured hours will be extended</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sections on this page impacted by these temporary changes are flagged as <span class="label label-info"><span
						class="h3 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">Temporary COVID-19 relief</span></span>.</p>

			<h2 class="mrgn-tp-0"> 6. After you've applied</h2>
			<p>If you are <strong>entitled</strong> to receive EI regular benefits, you should receive your first payment within
				28 days of the date we receive your application and all required documents.</p>
			<p><strong>You must complete bi-weekly reports</strong> to prove your eligibility and to receive benefits to which you
				may be entitled. Failure to do so can mean a loss of benefits.</p>
			<p>Before you start receiving EI benefits, there may be one week for which you will not be paid. This is what we call
				the "waiting period." The waiting period is like the deductible that you must pay for other types of insurance.</p>
			<p>If you are <strong>not entitled</strong> to receive <abbr>EI</abbr> benefits, we will contact you by letter or by
				telephone to explain why. If you disagree with our decision, you have the right to <a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-reconsideration.html">request a reconsideration</a>.</p>
			<p>Shortly after you submit your <abbr>EI</abbr> application, we will mail you an <abbr>EI</abbr> benefit statement.
				This does <strong>not</strong> mean that your application has been approved. Your Benefit statement will provide the
				information you need to complete your reports with our Internet reporting service or our Telephone reporting
				service.</p>
			<p>Your access code is the four-digit code printed in the shaded area of your benefit statement. You need to have it
				with you whenever you want to obtain information about your benefit claim and when you submit your reports. Your
				access code is used to identify you and ensure confidentiality of the information you provide. Store your access
				code in a safe place, separately from your Social Insurance Number.</p>
			<p>While your <abbr>EI</abbr> claim is active, you must submit reports every two weeks to show you are still entitled
				to receive <abbr>EI</abbr>. Failure to do so can mean a loss of benefits. The most convenient way to submit your
				reports is through the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-internet-reporting.html">Internet Reporting Service</a>.
				You can also use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-telephone-reporting.html">Telephone Reporting Service</a>
				at 1-800-531-7555 or <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-paper-reports.html">complete your paper report</a>. </p>
			<p>An <abbr>EI</abbr> claim will end if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you receive all the weeks of benefits to which you were entitled; <strong>or</strong> </li>
				<li>the payment timeframe during which you can receive benefits ends; <strong>or</strong></li>
				<li>you stop filing your bi-weekly report; <strong>or</strong></li>
				<li>you request a termination of your claim to file a new claim. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you start working before you finish your current <abbr>EI</abbr> claim, you must tell us when you complete your
				<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-internet-reporting.html">bi-weekly <abbr>EI</abbr> report</a> so we can adjust
				or stop your claim, depending on whether the work is full-time, part-time or by contract. If the work is short-term
				or contract you may re-activate your <abbr>EI</abbr> claim and continue to receive your bi-weekly payments when you
				are laid off.</p>
			<p>Missing <abbr>ROE</abbr>s can delay the processing of your claim.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If your employer issues <abbr>ROE</abbr>s in <strong>paper</strong> format, you must request copies of all
					<abbr>ROE</abbr>s issued to you during the last 52 weeks and provide them to Service Canada as soon as possible
					after you submit your <abbr>EI</abbr> application. Paper <abbr>ROE</abbr>s are generally filled out by hand and
					have serial numbers that start with A, E, K, L or Z. You must either mail us the original copies of your paper
					<abbr>ROE</abbr>s or drop them off in person at a Service Canada Centre. The mailing address will be provided to
					you on the Information and Confirmation page once you submit your online application for <abbr>EI</abbr> benefits.
				</li>
				<li>If your employer submits <abbr>ROE</abbr>s <strong>electronically</strong> to Service Canada, they are not
					required to print you a copy; however, they may give you one as a courtesy. If this is the case, the serial number
					of your <abbr>ROE</abbr> will start with W or S. Electronic <abbr>ROE</abbr>s are directly sent to Service Canada,
					therefore, you <strong>do not need</strong> to request copies of your <abbr>ROE</abbr>s from your employer, and
					you do not have to provide copies to Service Canada. You can view copies of your electronic <abbr>ROE</abbr>s by
					visiting <a rel="external" href="http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/online/mysca.shtml">My Service Canada
						Account</a>.</li>
