		<h2>Changes to support you during COVID-19</h2>
		<p>As of September 27, 2020, there are some temporary changes to the EI program to help you access EI regular
			benefits. The following changes will be in effect for 1 year and could apply to you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A minimum unemployment rate of 13.1% applies to all regions across Canada starting August 9, 2020 <ul>
					<li>If your region’s unemployment rate is higher than 13.1%, we’ll use the higher actual rate to calculate your
						benefits</li>
					<li>This means you can receive at least 26 weeks of regular benefits</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>You only need 120 insured hours to qualify for benefits because you’ll get a one-time credit of 300 insured
				hours to help you meet the required 420 insured hours of work</li>
			<li>You’ll receive at least $500 per week before taxes but you could receive more</li>
			<li>If you received the CERB, the 52-week period to accumulate insured hours will be extended</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Sections on this page impacted by these temporary changes are flagged as <span class="label label-info"><span
					class="h3 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">Temporary COVID-19 relief</span></span>.</p>

		<h2>7. While on EI</h2>
		<p>If you work while receiving regular benefits and have served your waiting period, you will be able to keep 50 cents
			of your EI benefits for every dollar you earn, up to 90 percent of the weekly insurable earnings used to calculate
			your EI benefit amount. This 90 percent amount is called the earnings threshold. If you earn any money above this
			threshold, we will deduct it dollar for dollar from your benefits.</p>
		<p>For more information, visit the <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/working-while-claim.html">Working While on Claim</a>
			page.</p>
		<p>When you work and receive benefits at the same time, you must <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-internet-reporting.html">report</a> your work earnings and hours for each week
			you work, in the week in which the work occurred.</p>
		<p>If you receive other payments while receiving EI, some <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/various-types-earnings.html">types of earnings</a> will be deducted from your EI
			benefits, while other types of income have no impact on your EI benefits. You can refer to the <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/earnings-chart.html">earnings chart</a>&nbsp; to find out if a payment constitutes
			earnings for benefit purposes and, if so, how those earnings are allocated.</p>
		<h2>Outside of Canada while on EI</h2>
		<p>You are <strong>not</strong> usually eligible to receive regular benefits while you are away from Canada. However,
			you may receive regular benefits if you show that you are available for work in Canada while abroad. You must also
			notify Service Canada of your travel by filling out a travel form on <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account (MSCA)</a> or through
			your bi-weekly report.</p>
		<p>You can be outside Canada for a period of seven consecutive days for the purpose of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>attending the funeral of a member of your immediate family or a close relative</li>
			<li>accompanying a member of your immediate family to a medical facility, provided that the treatment sought is not
				readily available in the family member's area of residence in Canada</li>
			<li>visiting a member of your immediate family who is seriously ill or injured</li>
			<li>attending a bona fide job interview</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can be away from Canada for a period of 14 consecutive days for the purpose of conducting a bona fide job
			search.</p>
		<p>If you indicate that you have taken measures to be reached if an employment opportunity presents itself during your
			absence and that you are able to return to Canada within 48 hours, we will accept that you have proven your
			availability.</p>
		<p>One measure we take to enforce this rule is to compare EI information with information from the Canada Border
			Services Agency. If we find you have been out of the country while collecting benefits, we will determine whether
			you were entitled to receive those benefits. If you were not entitled to receive them, we will calculate how much we
			overpaid you, and you will then have to repay the benefits.</p>
		<p>We may also impose penalties of up to three times your weekly benefit rate or three times the amount of your
			overpayment. As well, you may have to work more hours or, in the case of fishing benefits, you may need more
			insurable earnings to qualify for benefits in the future.</p>
		<h3>What support is available to help you find a job</h3>
		<section class="alert alert-info">
			<h3 class="wb-inv">Information</h3>
			<p>You can try out the new <a href="http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/job_alert.do">Job Alerts</a> service from <a
					href="http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/home-eng.do">Job Bank</a>. By subscribing, jobs that match your criteria will be
				emailed to you twice daily!</p>
		</section>
		<h3>Where can you get more information about your Employment Insurance claim</h3>
		<p>Information about your Employment Insurance (EI) claim can be obtained through <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account</a>. You can also
			register for Alert-Me to receive e-mail alerts when important new EI claim information is available in your MSCA.
		</p>
		<h3>Changing your address or requesting direct deposit information</h3>
		<p>Using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">My Service Canada Account</a> is the
			most convenient way to update your personal information, including your mailing address, telephone number, and
			banking information for direct deposit.</p>
		<p>If you don't already have an account, you can easily create one using your four-digit EI access code (printed in
			the shaded area at the bottom of your benefit statement). </p>
		<h3>Receiving regular benefits and other types of EI benefits at the same time</h3>
		<p>You can normally receive up to 50 weeks of benefits when regular benefits are combined with maternity, parental,
			sickness, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits in the same benefit period (of 52 weeks).</p>
		<p>The only exception is when EI regular benefits and extended parental benefits are paid during the 52-week period.
			As extended parental benefits are paid at a benefit rate of 33% of your average weekly insurable earnings, once 50
			weeks of benefits have been paid, the weeks of extended parental benefits will be converted to an equivalent number
			of weeks that would have been paid at the 55% benefit rate. This conversion will determine how many more weeks of
			regular benefits and special benefits can be paid to reach the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefits rate.
			Any weeks where you return to work during this period will be considered weeks paid for the purposes of calculating
			the equivalent of 50 weeks paid at the 55% benefit rate. Once the number of additional weeks that can be paid is
			determined, the 52-week benefit period will be extended to allow for the additional weeks to be paid.</p>
		<p>It important to note that you can’t receive more than one type of benefit at the same time.</p>
		<h3>Who can take care of an EI claim on your behalf</h3>
		<p>If you are unable to manage your own affairs due to health problems, a person other than an Employment and Social
			Development Canada (ESDC) employee may be appointed to act on your behalf. In that case, the form <a
				href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS3280">Appointment of
				Representative</a> must be completed and returned with your EI application.</p>
		<p>If you are eligible for EI, ESDC will authorize the payment of benefits to the representative acting on your
			behalf.</p>
		<h3>Requesting EI payments on behalf of a deceased person</h3>
		<p>When a person dies, Employment Insurance (EI) benefits payable to that person up to and including the day of the
			death may be paid to the legal representative<sup id="fn1-ref"> <a href="#fn1" class="fn-lnk"> <span
						class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a> </sup>, or to a person authorized to inherit property of the deceased
			person.</p>
		<p>If the deceased person had not applied for EI benefits, the legal representative must do the following, <strong>in
				the name of the deceased person</strong>, before benefits can be paid:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-regular-benefit/apply.html">apply for benefits</a> in the name of the
				deceased person;</li>
			<li>complete the form <a
					href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS2882">Request for Payment of
					Benefit on Behalf of a Deceased Person</a>; and</li>
			<li>provide a death certificate issued by the province or territory, a certificate from the director of a funeral
				home or an administrator of a hospital or clinic, or a letter from a physician, graduate nurse, or member of the
				clergy.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If the deceased person was receiving EI benefits before death, the legal representative must complete the form <a
				href="https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS2882">Request for Payment of
				Benefit on Behalf of a Deceased Person</a> to cancel these benefits.</p>
		<p>If EI benefits are paid after the death of someone in your family, the legal representative must repay the
			overpayment by making a cheque or money order to the Receiver General for Canada and sending it to the <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/overpayments/repayments.html">nearest overpayment
				recovery office</a>.</p>
		<h3>What is work sharing?</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/work-sharing/apply.html">EI Work Sharing program</a>
			assists employers and employees facing lay-offs due to a decline in production. With the work sharing agreement,
			available work is redistributed through a voluntary reduction in hours worked by all employees within one or more
			work units. This enables the employer to retain a full work force on a reduced work week, rather than laying off
			part of his or her work force. Employees are able to remain on the job and maintain skills and working habits and
			avoid uncertainties and hardship associated with total unemployment. </p>
		<h3>Money owing </h3>
		<p>Deductions can never be taken for money owed directly to a person or company. However, deductions can be taken from
			your EI benefits to repay money you owe, <strong>if</strong>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>you received an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/topic-list.html">overpayment from
					EI</a>;</li>
			<li>you received an advance or assistance from the Government of Canada or any of its agencies, a provincial or
				municipal government, or any other authority <strong>and</strong> an arrangement has been taken with EI for the
				deduction. Your consent must be given in writing to the deduction and payment by EI. Example: you received an <a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/reports/social-assistance.html">advance from a
					Social Services agency</a> while waiting for your EI benefits to start;</li>
			<li>the Department of Justice issued a court order, according to the <a
					href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-1.4/">Family Orders and Agreements (FOA) Enforcement Assistance
					Act</a>. Your EI benefits are garnished and forwarded to the Department of Justice that ensures payment to your
				spouse / dependents, according to the existing court order.</li>
			<li>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may collect taxes owing according to the <a
					href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/">Income Tax Act</a>, the <a
					href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-14/">Excise Tax Act</a> or other provisions enforced by the CRA.
				Any taxes owing to federal or provincial governments may be garnished from your EI benefits.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Protecting Employment Insurance — with your help</h3>
		<p>Service Canada works to protect the EI program from misuse. One of the ways we do this is by working with employers
			and claimants to ensure the accuracy of the information we receive. With your help, we can reduce the amount of
			misuse and ensure that the EI program is used as it should be — as a program that provides temporary financial
			assistance to individuals who qualify.</p>
		<p>A mistake is an unintentional act. We know claimants can make mistakes when filing their reports. Common mistakes
			include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>estimating weekly earnings instead of putting in the actual amount earned;</li>
			<li>declaring net earnings instead of gross earnings;</li>
			<li>forgetting to declare all the earnings received;</li>
			<li>writing or entering the wrong number when reporting earnings; or</li>
			<li>adding the number of hours or amount of earnings incorrectly.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some mistakes can delay benefit payments, while others can affect the amount of benefits you receive — meaning you
			were paid more or less than you were entitled to receive.</p>
		<p>For example, estimating your earnings can have the following effects:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you estimated your earnings for one week and your estimate was higher than the earnings you actually
				received, your benefit amount will be less than it should have been. If this happens, let us know and we will
				adjust your file to make sure you receive all the benefits to which you are entitled.</li>
			<li>If you estimated your earnings for one week and your estimate was lower than the earnings you actually received,
				your benefit amount will be higher than it should have been. Let us know if this happens. You will have to repay
				the excess amount, but we will ensure that repaying it causes no undue hardship. As well, we will adjust your file
				to reflect your accurate information.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you notice a mistake on a completed form or report, or if there is a change in your circumstances that could
			affect your EI claim, tell Service Canada immediately. This will help prevent any future problems with your claim.
		</p>
		<h3>Misrepresentation</h3>
		<p>If you knowingly withhold information, make misleading statements, or misrepresent the facts to make a false claim
			for benefits, this is considered misrepresentation. You could face severe monetary penalties or prosecution. This
			could also affect your future benefits. However, if you disclose your actions to Service Canada before an
			investigation begins, we may waive any monetary penalties and prosecutions that might otherwise apply.</p>
		<h3>Consequences of misrepresentation</h3>
		<h4>Interest on debt</h4>
		<p>When EI claimants receive benefits to which they are not entitled, the amount of the overpayment counts as a debt
			that must be repaid.</p>
		<p>Service Canada charges interest on this debt when it results from claimants who knowingly withhold information or
			make false or misleading representations or statements. However, we do not charge interest on debt that results when
			Service Canada makes an error in the benefit payment.</p>
		<p>The rate of interest is the Bank of Canada average rate plus 3%. Interest is calculated daily and compounded
			monthly.</p>
		<h4>Penalties</h4>
		<p>A penalty may be imposed on a claimant, an employer, or an individual acting on their behalf in relation to a claim
			for benefits when he or she has:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>knowingly made false or misleading representations or statements; or</li>
			<li>completed a statement without declaring essential information.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here is an example of a situation where penalties may be imposed:</p>
		<p>An EI benefit claimant goes on an ocean cruise for a month and arranges for a friend to conceal their absence by
			signing and returning two EI claimant reports. As a result, the claimant illegally received $350 in benefits for
			each of the four weeks of the cruise. After investigation, we find that this was the first time the claimant and the
			friend had misused the EI system. As well, we find that they both knew that what they did was illegal but they did
			it anyway.</p>
		<p>In this case, the claimant will have to repay $1,400 (four weeks of benefits at $350 per week) and may have to pay
			a penalty of $700 ($350 for each of the two false reports filed during the holiday). The friend may also have to pay
			a penalty of $700 for the illegal act of filing two false reports on behalf of the claimant.</p>
		<p>There are many situations when a penalty may apply, and the amount could become very high. Depending on the
			circumstances, the maximum penalty could be up to three times the amount of the overpayment, three times the weekly
			benefit rate for each incident of misrepresentation, or three times the maximum benefit rate.</p>
		<h3>Violations</h3>
		<p>Claimants who misuse the EI program and were assessed a violation may need more insurable earnings or hours to
			qualify for benefits in the future. The required amount rises based on the number and seriousness of
			misrepresentations that have been recorded in the five-year period before the start of their claims. </p>
		<h3>Rights and responsibilities</h3>
		<p>The EI program guarantees certain rights. There are also some basic responsibilities, for both you and Service
			Canada.</p>
		<p> <strong>You have the right to:</strong> </p>
		<ul>
			<li>file a claim for EI benefits;</li>
			<li>receive any benefits that are owing to you;</li>

				make about your benefits that you find unsatisfactory;</li>
			<li>see any government record that contains your personal information; and</li>
			<li>be served in the official language of your choice.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>As a <strong>claimant</strong> of EI benefits, your <strong>responsibilities</strong> include:</p>

				provide that proof at any time. Therefore you must keep your job search record for 6 years;</li>
			<li>you <strong>are not </strong>required to have employers sign your job search form or provide you with a letter
				confirming that you have applied for a job;</li>
			<li>let us know when you refuse any offers of employment; </li>

				as any other monies you may receive.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Your employer </h3>
		<p>If we decide to pay you benefits even if you quit, were fired for misconduct, refused work, or are involved in a
			labour dispute, we will notify your employer. If an employer believes that our decision is not justified, he or she
			can request a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-reconsideration.html?">reconsideration of that decision</a>.</p>
		<h3>Service Canada's responsibilities</h3>
		<p>At Service Canada, we are responsible for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>giving you prompt and courteous service;</li>
			<li>advising you of the programs and services that are available to you;</li>
			<li>serving you in the official language of your choice;</li>
			<li>determining if you are eligible to receive benefits — that is, whether or not you meet the qualifying conditions
				specified in the Employment Insurance Act and Regulations — and determining how many weeks of benefits you can
				receive;</li>
			<li>processing all claims within the same timeframe;</li>
			<li>issuing your first payment no later than 28 days after the date we receive your application, if you have
				provided us with all the required information and if you are eligible for benefits;</li>
			<li>giving you accurate information about your claim, including how you can share parental benefits with your
				EI-eligible spouse or partner, compassionate care or family caregiver benefits with other EI-eligible family
				members, and whether or not you will need to serve a one-week waiting period; and</li>
			<li>letting you know about decisions we've made about your claim and explaining the process to follow if you
				disagree with a decision.</li>

					<li>If the deceased person left a court-approved will (a testamentary estate), the executor appointed in the
						will is considered as the legal representative. In Quebec, a notarized will does not have to be
						court-approved;</li>
					<li>If the deceased person did not leave a will (an intestate estate), but the court appointed an administrator
						of the estate by way of letters of administration, the administrator is considered the legal representative;
					</li>
					<li>If the total value of the estate is not large enough to justify obtaining an order or probate of the will,
						one of the persons authorized to inherit property of the deceased person may ask for the payment of benefits
						in the name of the deceased person.</li>
