	</ul>

	<section>
		<h2 id="amendments">Amend an Interim Order Authorization</h2>
		
		<p>Section 6 of the <em>Interim Order</em> states that no person can import or sell a COVID-19 medical device if there are significant differences in the device from that which was initially submitted to Health Canada for approval under the <em>Interim Order</em>, unless the Minister has issued an amended authorization. These changes apply to any information submitted to the Minister under section 4 of this <em>Interim Order</em>, or as a response to a request for additional information under section 9. </p>
		
		<p>The onus is on the authorization holder (i.e., the manufacturer) to identify and communicate these significant differences to Health Canada. It is recommended that a summary of the changes, compared to that which was initially approved, is submitted to Health Canada in electronic format using the following email address: </p>
		
		<p><a href="mailto:hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca">hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca</a></p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2 id="reporting">Incident Reporting</h2>
		<p>The holder of the COVID-19 medical device authorization for the importation or sale of the device is to report to Health Canada within 10 days of becoming aware, all Canadian incidents that:</p>
		
		<ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
		<li>Are related to a failure of device or a deterioration in its quality or effectiveness, or any inadequacy in its labelling or in its directions for use; <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>Have led to the death or a serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or other person, or could do so were it to recur. </li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>A description, the frequency and the circumstances surrounding the incident is also to be provided as part of the report. The description of each type of problem should be clear and any remedial or corrective actions undertaken should be explained. The submission should clearly state that the device was approved under the <em>Interim Order</em>, and provide the <em>Interim Order</em> authorization number in lieu of a medical device license number.</p>
		
		<p>The incident report can be submitted according to the procedure outlined in the following website:</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medeffect-canada/adverse-reaction-reporting/mandatory-medical-device-problem-reporting-form-industry-adverse-reaction-reporting.html">Mandatory Medical Device Problem Reporting Form for Industry</a></p>
		
		<p>It is expected that the authorization holder submit a preliminary report to Health Canada within 10 days, followed by a final report once investigation is completed.</p>
		
		<h3 id="recalls">Recall</h3>
		<p>Any device authorized under this <em>Interim Order</em> is subject to Mandatory Recall provisions under <em>The Food and Drugs Act</em>. In addition, while the ability for the Minister to order a mandatory recall is still available, manufacturers should proactively notify Health Canada if they become aware of the need to recall their COVID-19 medical device in Canada. The following link provides guidance on to how to conduct a recall in Canada: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/problem-reporting/medical-devices-recall-guide-0054.html">Guide to Recall of Medical Devices (GUI-0054)</a>.
	
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2 id="ending">When the Interim Order ends</h2>
		<p>The authorization for importation or sale is only valid for so as long as the <em>Interim Order</em> is in effect.</p>
		<p>The <em>Interim Order</em> will expire after a one year after it came into effect, but may be subject to renewal based on the ongoing public health need.</p>

		<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
		<p>Due to the nature of the application and issuance of expedited authorization to deal with the significant public health risk of COVID-19, Health Canada may, at any time, impose terms and conditions on the authorization for importation or sale of COVID-19 medical devices, or amend them.</p>
		
		<h3>Cancellation </h3>
		<p>As per above, Health Canada may cancel the authorization for importation or sale under the following conditions if: </p>
		
		<ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
		<li>Health Canada determines that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks of the device and that the health or safety of Canadian patients, users or any other person may be unduly affected; </li>
		<li>Health Canada determines that the terms and conditions imposed are not met;</li>
		<li>A medical device licence is issued for the COVID-19 medical device under section 36 of the Regulations; <strong>or</strong></li>
		<li>The authorization for sale of a COVID-19 medical device that has been issued by a foreign regulatory authority is suspended or cancelled.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>An authorization for importation or sale under the <em>Interim Order</em> is subject to compliance and enforcement should Health Canada be made aware of issues of noncompliance.&nbsp; </p>
		
		<h3 id="a210">Additional Information and Material</h3>
		
		<p>Health Canada may, at any time, request additional information or material (including samples) from the applicant in order to ensure that the provisions under section 5 of the <em>Interim Order</em> continue to be met. This information will be used to determine whether Health Canada will move forward with the issuance, amendment or cancellation of the COVID-19 medical device authorization.</p>
