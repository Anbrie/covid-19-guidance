			<summary>Alternative requirements for medical devices authorized abroad</summary>
			<div id="foreign-approval">
				<p>4(3) of the <em>Interim Order</em> stipulates that an applicant may omit the information required to be submitted in their initial application, specifically, items:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>4(1)(g) Quality safety and effectiveness information</li>
					<li>4(2)(a) Materials (class III and IV devices)</li>
					<li>4(2)(b) Marketing history (class III and IV devices)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Instead, you will be required to provide evidence that your COVID-19 medical device has gained market approval by a foreign regulatory authority. This approval need not be at the National level, as Health Canada may accept approval at the State level.</p>
				<p>This evidence should include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a copy of the formal approval letter issued by the authority</li>
					<li>any review summaries authored by the authority</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For absolute certainty, if the Minister deems that the evidence of approval by a foreign authority is insufficient to ensure that section 5 of the <em>Interim Order</em> is met, the Minister may request additional information under section 9 of the <em>Interim Order</em>, and may also decide to issue an authorization with terms and conditions under section 7. </p>
				<p>If a foreign jurisdiction waives all pre-market submission and evaluation requirements, this would not be considered a foreign regulatory approval for the purposes of the <em>Interim Order</em>. </p>

		<h2 id="cov-standards">Specifications or standards to use as reference</h2>
		<p>A manufacturer may choose to demonstrate conformance with a recognized standard or may elect to address the relevant issues in another manner.</p>
		<p>If a standard is recognized, a manufacturer applying for an authorization for a device to which that standard applies must either:</p>
		<ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
			<li>meet the standard; or</li>
			<li>meet an equivalent or better standard; or</li>
			<li>provide alternate evidence of safety or efficacy</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In case the manufacturer chooses option b) or c), detailed information must be submitted with the device authorization application. If the manufacturer does none of the above, an authorization will not be issued.</p>
		<p>Not all devices, or elements of device safety and effectiveness may be addressed by recognized standards, especially for new types of devices and emerging technologies.</p>
