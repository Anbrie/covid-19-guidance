				<h3 id="a25">Submitting an application for a COVID-19 medical device</h3>
				<p>An application for medical devices manufactured, sold or represented for use in relation to COVID-19 shall contain sufficient information and material for the Minister to render a decision whether or not to issue a COVID-19 medical device authorization, on the basis of the issuance criteria in s.5 of the <em>Interim Order</em>. This information is highlighted in section 4 of the <em>Interim Order Respecting the Importation and Sale of Medical Devices for Use in Relation to COVID-19. </em></p>
				<p>This information can be submitted electronically, in whatever manner the applicant chooses. Applicants are welcome to use standard document submission guidelines (i.e. the ToC format), or provide a “question and answer” style of application, using the criteria specified below as headers. An application form has also been developed to facilitate the application process.  The use of the application form is optional but is highly recommended to help ensure applicants have submitted the necessary information.</p>
				<p>Important: Please ensure that the application has been signed by a senior official of the manufacturer </p>
				
				<p>Clarification on the specifics of the information required in an application filed in accordance with the <em>Interim Order Respecting the Importation and Sale of Medical Devices for Use in Relation to COVID-19</em> is provided below.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Name of the Device</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(a) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires including the name of the device. This is the name that appears on the labelling proper and for which the authorization shall be issued under the Order. It includes any information necessary for the user to identify the device and to distinguish it from similar devices. In order to prevent duplication, multiple submissions for the same product should not be filed with Health Canada.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Class of the Device</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(b) of the <em>Interim Order</em> must specify the class of the device. This is the classification that is attributed to the device according to the rules set out in Schedule 1 of the <em>Medical Devices Regulations</em>. According to the classification scheme, Class I represents the lowest risk and Class IV represents the highest risk. For this purposes of submitting an application under the <em>Interim Order</em>, a COVID-19 medical device can be classified into more than one class, the class representing the higher risk applies.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Identifier of the Device</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(c) of the <em>Interim Order </em>requires the identifier of the device, including the identifier of any medical device that is part of a system, test kit, medical device group, medical device family or medical device group family be provided. For greater certainty, the definitions of each of these instances have been included above (see “Definitions”).</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Manufacturer information</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(d) and 4(1)(e) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires the submission of the name and address of the manufacturer as it appears on the device label, including the address where the device is manufactured (if different). For greater certainty, this should be listed as the legal manufacturer of the device.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Intended use of the device</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(f) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires the submission include information related to the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention for which the COVID-19 medical device be provided. This information is crucial in establishing an understanding of the device and the device classification. The following information should be included in this section:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
				</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>intended purpose, mechanism of action,    indications for use, conditions for which the device is used (the intended    use statement should be <em>verbatim</em> as it appears on the device labelling);</li>
				<li>patient population for which the device is    intended including age range, if applicable, and specific diagnoses;</li>
				<li>anatomical and physiological particulars    related to the patient using the device, if applicable;</li>
				<li>whether or not the device uses an energy    source and whether energy is transferred to the patient;</li>
				<li>the document version number and the date    where the formal intended use appears.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong><em>Attestation for Post-Market Oversight</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(i) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires the applicant to provide an attestation that documented procedures are in place in respect of distribution records, complaint handling, incident reporting and recalls. Appendix B provides an example of what Health Canada would look for in an attestation from an applicant (this information is also directly included in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/covid19-interim-order-drugs-medical-devices-special-foods/medical-device-exceptional-import/application-form-authorization-importation-sale-medical-device-eng.docx">application form in Appendix A</a>).</p>
