		 <h2 id="a1">Providing a safe and effective vaccine</h2>
		 	<p>Pandemic vaccines and drugs are needed to achieve Canada's goals to: </p>
				 <ol>
					 <li>reduce serious illness and overall deaths during the pandemic (due to all causes), and </li>
					 <li>minimize societal disruption, including reducing the burden on health care resources </li>
				 </ol> 
			<p>Providing a safe and effective vaccine for all Canadians as quickly as possible is the goal of Canada’s pandemic vaccine strategy. The earlier the vaccine is available, the greater its impact. Running clinical trials in Canada of potential COVID-19 vaccines is crucial to delivering vaccines.</p>
			<p>Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is providing rapid guidance on research priorities for COVID-19 vaccine candidates to support public health decision making. </p>
			<p>Investment in research and clinical trials for vaccines and treatments began early in the pandemic. In addition to other direct investments, 99 or more research projects across the country were funded by the federal and provincial agencies.  </p>
			<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/institutes-health-research/news/2020/03/government-of-canada-funds-49-additional-covid-19-research-projects-details-of-the-funded-projects.html">Canadian Institutes of Health Research COVID-19 research grants</a></p>
		 
		 <h2 id="a2">Potential drugs and vaccines</h2>
		 
		 <p>Many potential drugs and vaccines are being investigated in Canada and around the world for use against COVID-19. In addition to investing in and supporting research and trials in Canada, we are closely tracking all potential drugs and vaccines in development.</p>

		 <p>Early and late phase clinical trials of candidate COVID-19 vaccines are being guided by input from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). The findings of these trials will be used to inform vaccine recommendations to Canadian jurisdictions once a COVID-19 vaccine or vaccines become available in Canada.</p>
		
		<p>Potential COVID-19 vaccines currently being investigated include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>CanSino Biologics Inc.: Phase I/II clinical trial of Ad5-nCoV Vaccine began May 15, 2020 </li>
			<li>Medicago Inc.: Phase I clinical trial of a recombinant coronavirus-Like particle COVID-19 vaccine began July 9, 2020</li>
			<li>University of Saskatchewan's VIDO-Intervac: recombinant protein antigen vaccine is preparing for human clinical trials</li>
		</ul> 
		<p>Drugs and treatment options in Canadian clinical trials and research studies include: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>antiviral drugs</li>
		<li>anti-malarial drugs</li>
		<li>monoclonal antibodies and other drugs that address inflammation</li>
		<li><a href="https://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2020/72957a-eng.php">convalescent plasma</a> collected from patients who have recovered from COVID-19</li>

		<h2 id="a3">Planning ahead for delivering vaccines</h2>
		<p>Progress is being made towards the efficient, effective and equitable distribution and administration of an eventual COVID-19 vaccine. These efforts include: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Purchasing supplies - 75 million syringes have been ordered by <a href="">Public Services and Procurement Canada</a></li>
			<li>Setting up production capacity inside and outside Canada</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/research-priorities-covid-19-vaccines.html#toc8">Feasibility and equity analyses </a>of options for storage and handling and administration  </li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="a4">Safe drugs and vaccines for Canada and the world</h2>
		<p>Currently, there are no drugs or vaccines authorized to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19 in Canada. Certain authorized products may ease COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever and cough.</p>
		<p>Drugs, including vaccines, are regulated under the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em> and <em>Regulations</em>. They must meet the regulatory requirements for safety, efficacy and quality before they can be sold in Canada. </p>
		   <p> Learn more about Canada's <a href="">COVID-19 regulatory process</a></p>
		 
		   <p>We are also <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/engaging-international-partners.html">working with international partners</a> on a coordinated and well-aligned approach to this global pandemic. This ensures that health products are safe, effective and quickly available to Canadians. Collaboration also helps advance the development of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines that will save lives and protect the health and safety of people everywhere. </p>
		   <p>Canada has committed to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/05/minister-gould-announces-funding-for-global-vaccinations.html">funding global vaccinations for COVID-19</a></p>
