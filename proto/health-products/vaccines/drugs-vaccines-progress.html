		 <p>79% of Canadians report via Statistics Canada they are likely to get a COVID-19 vaccination when it's available. Safe and effective drugs and vaccines are in progress to support Canadians through and out of this pandemic. Currently, there are no vaccines authorized to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19 in Canada.  </p> 
		 <h3>Vaccine clinical trials</h3>
		 <p>Clinical trials are crucial to ensuring that potential COVID-19 vaccines are safe for Canadians and effectively prevent infections. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is providing rapid guidance on clinical trial research priorities for COVID-19 vaccine candidates. </p>

All of the potential vaccines will require Health Canada regulatory approval before the vaccines can be delivered to Canadians. Active negotiations with other potential vaccine suppliers are also under way.  </p>
