		 <h3>Vaccine clinicial trials</h3>
		 <p>Clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines are being guided by input from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). The findings of these trials will be used to inform vaccine recommendations to Canadian jurisdictions once a COVID-19 vaccine or vaccines become available in Canada.</p>
		 <p>Clinical trials in Canada:</p>

		<h3>Drug treatment progress</h3>
		<p>Drugs and treatment options in Canadian clinical trials and research studies include: </p>
		<ul>
		<li>antiviral drugs</li>
		<li>anti-malarial drugs</li>
		<li>monoclonal antibodies and other drugs that address inflammation</li>
		<li><a href="https://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2020/72957a-eng.php">convalescent plasma</a> collected from patients who have recovered from COVID-19</li>
		<li>medical gases</li>
		</ul>
		<p>See Health Canada's complete <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-clinical-trials/list-authorized-trials.html">list of authorized clinical trials for drugs and vaccines</a> for COVID-19.</p> 
		 
		 
		 <h2 id="a2">Ensuring safe and effective vaccines and drug treatments</h2>
			<p>Providing a safe and effective vaccine for all Canadians as quickly as possible is the goal of Canada’s pandemic vaccine strategy. The earlier the vaccine is available, the greater its impact. Clinical trials in Canada are crucial to ensuring that potential COVID-19 vaccines are safe for Canadians and effectively prevent infections. Clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are in progress across the country.</p>
			<p>Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is providing rapid guidance on clinical trial research priorities for COVID-19 vaccine candidates. </p>

		<h2 id="a3">Planning ahead for vaccinations</h2>
		<p>Progress is being made towards the efficient, effective and equitable distribution and administration of an eventual COVID-19 vaccine. These efforts include: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Purchasing supplies - 75 million syringes have been ordered by <a href="">Public Services and Procurement Canada</a></li>
			<li>Setting up production capacity inside and outside Canada</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/research-priorities-covid-19-vaccines.html#toc8">Feasibility and equity analyses </a>of options for storage and handling and administration  </li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="a4">Safe drugs and vaccines for Canada and the world</h2>
		<p>Currently, there are no drugs or vaccines authorized to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19 in Canada. Certain authorized products may ease COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever and cough.</p>
		<p>Drugs, including vaccines, are regulated under the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em> and <em>Regulations</em>. They must meet the regulatory requirements for safety, efficacy and quality before they can be sold in Canada. </p>
		   <p> Learn more about Canada's <a href="">COVID-19 regulatory process</a></p>
		 
		   <p>We are also <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/engaging-international-partners.html">working with international partners</a> on a coordinated and well-aligned approach to this global pandemic. This ensures that health products are safe, effective and quickly available to Canadians. Collaboration also helps advance the development of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines that will save lives and protect the health and safety of people everywhere. </p>
