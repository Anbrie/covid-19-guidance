 </ul>
 
 <h2 id="a1">Clinical trial regulations</h2>
 
 <p><a href="/en/health-canada/services/clinical-trials.html">Clinical trials</a> are studies authorized by Health Canada that investigate the safety and efficacy of a drug or vaccine that:</p>

<ul>
 <li>exists but is to be used for another purpose or</li> 
<li>is not yet available in Canada</li> 
</ul>

<p>Specifically, clinical trials examine the risks and benefits of a drug or vaccine.</p> 

<p>Sponsors must apply to conduct a clinical trial in Canada.</p>

<p>For drug and vaccine clinical trials not related to COVID-19, existing regulations  and processes  still apply.</p>
 
 <h2 id="a2">Applying to conduct a clinical trial for COVID-19 purposes</h2>
 
 <p>Health  Canada is prioritizing the review of all COVID-19-related clinical trial  applications and has already <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-clinical-trials/list-authorized-trials.html">authorized a number of trials</a>.</p>
<p>Sponsors of COVID-19-related drug and vaccine clinical trials can choose between 2 different processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>existing <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/clinical-trials/clinical-trial-sponsors-applications.html">process</a> outlined in the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/c.r.c.%2C_c._870/page-133.html#h-577812"><em>Food and Drug Regulations</em></a> or</li>
<li>process outlined in the new interim order for clinical trials for medical devices and drugs related to COVID-19</li>
</ul> 

<p>On May 23, 2020, the Minister of Health signed an <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/interim-order-respecting-clinical-trials-medical-devices-drugs.html">interim order for clinical trials for medical devices and drugs related to COVID-19</a>. The interim order streamlines the investigation of potential therapies and facilitates broader access for Canadians to COVID-19 related investigational drugs and medical devices. An interim order is one of the fastest mechanisms available to address large-scale public health emergencies, without following the usual regulatory process.</p>

<p>Under the interim order, Health Canada is reducing the administrative burden for sponsors applying to conduct a COVID-19 clinical trial, while maintaining patient safety and the validity of trial results. It is also introducing flexibility by expanding the types of health care professionals who can conduct a clinical trial. Further information can be found in the <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/interim-order-respecting-clinical-trials-medical-devices-drugs/notice-interim-order.html">interim order notice</a>.</p>

<p>Sponsors may apply to Health Canada for authorization to conduct a COVID-19 clinical trial.</p>

<p>The drug or vaccine in question must be:</p>

<ul>
<li>an existing, marketed product(s) in Canada to be used as COVID-19 treatments or</li>
<li>new COVID-19 vaccines and treatments currently under development</li>
</ul>
<p>Before applying, please review the <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/interim-order-respecting-clinical-trials-medical-devices-drugs/drug-guidance.html">guidance document</a> and <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/interim-order-respecting-clinical-trials-medical-devices-drugs/notice-guidance.html">guidance document notice</a>. We encourage you to contact Health Canada to request a pre-clinical consultation:</p>

<ul>
<li> For enquiries about clinical trials for COVID-19 <strong>vaccines</strong> and <strong>biologic drugs</strong>, please contact <a href="mailto:hc.bgtd.ora.sc@canada.ca">hc.bgtd.ora.sc@canada.ca</a>.</li>
<li> For enquiries about clinical trials for COVID-19 <strong>pharmaceutical drugs</strong>, please contact <a href="mailto:OCT_BEC_Enquiries_Enquetes@hc-sc.gc.ca">OCT_BEC_Enquiries_Enquetes@hc-sc.gc.ca</a>.</li> 
</ul>

<p>We are expediting discussions with sponsors that have products in development <strong>and</strong> sufficient pre-clinical data.</p>
