	<section>
		<h3 id="labelling">Labelling</h3>
	
		<p>For the express purpose of expediting access to COVID-19 medical devices to the Canadian market, Health Canada will accept labelling in either English or French at the time of application.</p>
		
		<p>The following information will be required on the label:</p>
		
		<p>a)The name of the device;</p>
		
		
		<p>Each device including a system, medical device group, medical device family, or medical device group family must have a name. The device licence is issued for (a) the device name on the label which may describe one device, (b) an administrative grouping of devices sold for convenience under a single name or (c) a grouping of devices that carry the same generic name specifying the intended use of the devices. This name permits the user to identify it and distinguish it from other devices or device types.</p>
		
		
		<p>b) The name and address of the manufacturer;</p>
		<p>If more than one name appears on the label, the relationship of each name to the device must be made clear, such as in the case of private labelling agreements between the manufacturer and the distributor or importer. The device licence is issued to the manufacturer named on the label.</p>
		
		<p>c) The identifier of the device, including the identifier of any medical device that is part of a system, test kit, medical device group, medical device family or medical device group family;</p>
		
		<p>The identifier is a unique number assigned to the device by the manufacturer, which along with the name of the device, will permit a device to be distinguished from all other devices. It may be a catalogue number, model number, or a barcode and will permit, in combination with the name, a certain level of control and traceability in the market place.</p>
		
		<p>d) In the case of a Class III or IV device, the control number;</p>
		
		<p>The control number means a unique series of letters, numbers or symbols, or any combination of these, that is assigned to a COVID-19 medical device by the manufacturer and, from which the history of the manufacturing, packaging, labelling or distribution of a unit, lot or batch of finished devices can be determined. The control number allows the device to be traced from manufacture to the end user, including an individual in whom the device may have been implanted. Along with the name of the device and the identifier, it provides the highest degree of traceability.</p>
		
		<p>This is a requirement for Class III and Class IV devices only. Although not mandatory for Class I and Class II devices, the control number enhances postmarket traceability.</p>
		
		<p>(e) if the contents are not readily apparent, an indication of what the package contains, expressed in terms appropriate to the device, such as the size, net weight, length, volume or number of units;</p>
		
		<p>The intent of this requirement is to provide specific information describing the package contents to the user and to enable the user to make an informed choice when comparing similar devices. The information will also allow the user to select a size suitable for his/her purposes. Units should be expressed in metric or SI units (International System of Units). When applicable, the material used in the device should be specified. </p>
		
		<p>f) If the device is sterilized by the manufacter and the manufacturer intends for it to be sold in a sterile condition, then this must be indicated on the label.</p>
		
		<p>g) the expiry date of the device, if the device has one. This is to be determined by the manufacturer on the basis of the component that has the shortest projected useful life;</p>
		
		<p>The life of the least stable component determines the expiration date. The expiration date must be based on the results of studies which demonstrate that the device will perform as intended and will meet its specifications until that date. The date should be expressed in the internationally accepted format (ISO 8601 Data Elements and Interchange Formats-Information Exchange-Representation of Dates and Times): year (in four digits), month (in two digits), and day (in two digits). The separator for the three portions of the date should be a hyphen (-). </p>
		
		<p>h) unless self-evident to the intended user, the medical conditions, purposes and uses for which the device is manufactured, sold or represented, as well as the performance specifications of the device if those specifications are necessary for proper use;</p>
		
		<p>This section requires the manufacturer to state succinctly what the device is intended to do and on which population subgroup the device is intended to be used, for example, "For use in adults over 18 years of age." The purposes and uses refer to the function of the device as well as to the objective intent of the manufacturer. This intent may be communicated by the labelling claims, advertising, or written or oral statements made by the manufacturer or representatives.</p>
		
		<p>There are some devices for which the indications for use are commonly understood, and such labelling may not be necessary. </p>
		
		<p>i) the directions for use, unless directions are not required, for the device to be used safely and effectively; </p>
		
		<p>This is the information supplied to the lay person and/or the health care professional enabling them to use the device without causing unnecessary harm to themselves or another person and to achieve the desired result. The Directions for use should be written at a level commensurate with the training of the expected users.</p>
		
		<p>For some complex, diagnostic, active or powered devices, the Directions for use may require a special Surgeon's Instruction Manual, Operator's Manual, and a User's Manual.</p>
		
		<p>j) any special storage conditions applicable to the device.</p>
		
		<p>Some devices may deteriorate rapidly under certain environmental conditions as they relate to temperature, humidity, or light, and may need to be stored in a specified manner to prevent this deterioration. The user must be provided with this information in order to decide if such storage conditions are accessible or within their means. Storage temperatures should be provided in degrees Celsius.</p>
