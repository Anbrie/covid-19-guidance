This information is highlighted in section 4 of the <em>Interim Order Respecting the Importation and Sale of Medical Devices for Use in Relation to COVID-19. </em></p>
				
				<p>This information can be submitted electronically, in whatever manner the applicant chooses. Applicants are welcome to use standard document submission guidelines (ie: the ToC format), or provide a “question and answer” style of application, using the criteria specified below as headers. An application form has also been developed to facilitate the application process.  The use of the application form is optional but is highly recommended to help ensure applicants have submitted the necessary information.  Applications should be submitted to the following email address: </p>
				
				<p><a href="mailto:hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca">hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca</a> with the subject line: COVID IO Submission. </p>
				
				<p>Important: Please ensure that the application has been signed by a senior official of the manufacturer </p>
				
				<p>Clarification on the specifics of the information required in an application filed in accordance with the <em>Interim Order Respecting the Importation and Sale of Medical Devices for Use in Relation to COVID-19</em> is provided below.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Name of the Device</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(a) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires including the name of the device. This is the name that appears on the labelling proper and for which the authorization shall be issued under the Order. It includes any information necessary for the user to identify the device and to distinguish it from similar devices.</p>
				
				
				
				<p><strong><em>Class of the Device</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(b) of the <em>Interim Order</em> must specify the class of the device. This is the classification that is attributed to the device according to the rules set out in Schedule 1 of the <em>Medical Devices Regulations</em>. According to the classification scheme, Class I represents the lowest risk and Class IV represents the highest risk. For this purposes of submitting an application under the <em>Interim Order</em>, a COVID-19 medical device can be classified into more than one class, the class representing the higher risk applies.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Identifier of the Device</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(c) of the <em>Interim Order </em>requires the identifier of the device, including the identifier of any medical device that is part of a system, test kit, medical device group, medical device family or medical device group family be provided. For greater certainty, the definitions of each of these instances have been included above (see “Definitions”).</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Manufacturer information</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(d) and 4(1)(e) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires the submission of the name and address of the manufacturer as it appears on the device label, including the address where the device is manufactured (if different). For greater certainty, this should be listed as the legal manufacturer of the device.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Intended use of the device</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(f) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires the submission include information related to the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention for which the COVID-19 medical device be provided. This information is crucial in establishing an understanding of the device and the device classification. The following information should be included in this section:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
				</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>intended purpose, mechanism of action,    indications for use, conditions for which the device is used (the intended    use statement should be <em>verbatim</em> as it appears on the device labelling);</li>
				<li>patient population for which the device is    intended including age range, if applicable, and specific diagnoses;</li>
				<li>anatomical and physiological particulars    related to the patient using the device, if applicable;</li>
				<li>whether or not the device uses an energy    source and whether energy is transferred to the patient;</li>
				<li>the document version number and the date    where the formal intended use appears.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong><em>Quality, Safety and Effectiveness information</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(g) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requests that the applicant provide the known information in relation to the quality, safety and effectiveness of the device. To clarify the type of information that should be submitted, the following non-exhaustive list is provided as a guide to inform a submission. The Minister, under section 9 of the <em>Interim Order</em>, may request any additional information, if the information provided is deemed insufficient&nbsp; to render a decision whether to grant an authorization under this <em>Interim Order</em>. </p>
				
				<ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
				<li>A clear description of the device, including how it works, any accessories to be used with it, and diagrams/photos of the device;</li>
				<li>A copy of the manufacturer’s Quality Manufacturing System Certificate, evidence of Good Manufacturing Practices, or other;</li>
				<li>A discussion of whether any components are manufactured using additive manufacturing (3D printing, laser sintering, bioprinting, etc.);</li>
				<li>If this device is manufactured from or incorporates animal or human tissue or their derivative, evidence of biological safety of the device;</li>
				<li>A summary of any mechanical/bench testing data performed for the device;</li>
				<li>A summary of any animal testing and clinical investigations carried out with the device;</li>
				<li>A summary of any biocompatibility testing performed with the device (if applicable);</li>
				<li>A summary of the evidence of shelf-life and packaging validation testing (if applicable);</li>
				<li>A summary of electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing (if applicable);</li>
				<li>If the device is intended to be used at point of care or sold directly to a consumer, marketing materials for the device;</li>
				<li>If the device is intended to be sold in a sterile condition, a description of the sterilization method and a summary of sterilization validation testing performed;</li>
				<li>A list of applicable standards used in the design/manufacture of the device;</li>

				<li>If the COVID-19 medical device is, or includes an <em>in-vitro</em> diagnostic device, analytical validation studies including but not limited to, specimen validation testing, sample preparation validation, the limit of detection, when applicable, inclusivity, cross reactivity (in silico analysis and cross reactivity testing), preliminary precision results (if applicable), stability of samples, preliminary reagent stability and clinical validity studies. </li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>If the applicant has questions specific to the type of quality, safety and effectiveness information, they are urged to contact the Medical Devices Directorate, using the following email address:</p>
				
				<p><a href="mailto:hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca">hc.devicelicensing-homologationinstruments.sc@canada.ca</a></p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Directions for Use</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(h) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requests that the applicant provide the directions for use, unless directions are not required for the device to be used safely and effectively. This is the information supplied to the lay person and/or the health care professional enabling them to use the device without causing unnecessary harm to themselves or another person and to achieve the desired result. The Directions for Use should be written at a level commensurate with the training of the expected users.</p>
				
				<p>For some complex, active or powered devices, the Directions for Use may require a special Surgeon's Instruction Manual, Operator's Manual, and a User's Manual.</p>
				
				<p>All documents should have a control or version number clearly indicated in the document.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Attestation for Post-Market Oversight</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(i) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires the applicant to provide an attestation that documented procedures are in place in respect of distribution records, complaint handling, incident reporting and recalls. Appendix B provides an example of what Health Canada would look for in an attestation from an applicant (this information is also directly included in the <a href="/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/covid19-interim-order-drugs-medical-devices-special-foods/medical-device-exceptional-import/application-form-authorization-importation-sale-medical-device-eng.docx">COVID-19 application form for authorization of importation or sale of medical devices</a>).</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Device Label</em></strong><br>
				4(1)(j) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires that the applicant provides a copy of the label of the COVID-19 medical device. This label should be expressed in a legible, permanent and prominent manner, in terms that are easily understood by the intended user. Additionally, where a package that contains a COVID-19 medical device is too small to display all the information required according to section 10 of the <em>Interim Order</em>, the directions for use shall accompany the device but need not be on the outside of the package or be visible under normal conditions for sale.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Materials</em></strong><br>
				4(2)(a) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires that, for Class III and IV COVID-19 medical devices, the applicant provides a description of the materials used in the manufacture and packaging of the device. Additionally, if there are any materials that are patient contacting for any period of time, biocompatibility testing of those materials may be required in order to render a decision on whether the Minister may issue an authorization.</p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Marketing History</em></strong><br>
				4(2)(b) of the <em>Interim Order</em> requires that, for Class III and IV COVID-19 medical devices, the applicant provides a list of countries other than Canada where the device has been sold, the total number of units sold in those countries, and a summary of any reported problems with the device and any recalls of the device in those countries. This information can be provided in any format, however, summary tables are preferred. </p>
				
				<p><strong><em>Foreign Regulatory Approval</em></strong><br>
				4(3) of the <em>Interim Order</em> stipulates that an applicant may omit the information required to be submitted in their initial application, specifically, items 4(1)(g), 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(b), if they provide evidence that their COVID-19 medical device has gained market approval by a foreign regulatory authority. This approval need not be at the National level, as Health Canada may accept approval at the State level. This evidence should include a copy of the formal approval letter issued by the authority, as well as any review summaries authored by the authority. For absolute certainty, if the Minister deems that the evidence of approval by a foreign authority is insufficient to ensure that section 5 of the <em>Interim Order</em> is met, the Minister may request additional information under section 9 of the <em>Interim Order</em>, and may also decide to issue an authorization with terms and conditions under section 7. </p>
				
				<p>If a foreign jurisdiction waives all pre-market submission and evaluation requirements, this would not be considered a foreign regulatory approval for the purposes of the <em>Interim Order</em>. </p>
