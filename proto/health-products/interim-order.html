	<section>
		<h2 id="activities">Devices expedited by applications under the Interim Order</h2>
		<p>The <em>Interim Order</em> provides an expedited authorization pathway for </p>
		<ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
			<li>new COVID-19-medical devices that are not yet licensed in Canada or other jurisdictions, </li>
			<li>COVID-19-related uses for existing devices licensed under the <em>Medical Device Regulations</em>, or under this <em>Interim Order</em>, and </li>
			<li>COVID-19 medical devices that leverage an authorization of a device from a trusted foreign regulatory authority, whereby the Minister would maintain the ability to request additional information on a case-by-case basis.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This expedited authorization for sale or import does not apply to medical device licences which are currently suspended on the grounds of safety or effectiveness concerns. It is not intended to permit sale or import of previously licensed medical devices with identified safety or effectiveness concerns.</p>
		<p>Note: The authorization for importation and sale is only valid for as long as the <em>Interim Order</em> is in effect, for a period of up to one year, unless it is renewed. </p>
		<details>
			<summary>More about how this guidance supports the IO application process</summary>
			<p>The <em>Interim Order</em> outlines Health Canada’s expectation and the information that is required to obtain authorization to import and sell COVID-19 medical devices in Canada.  Importantly, an authorization under this <em>Interim Order</em> will be granted only if Health Canada determines that there is a public health need for the importation or sale of the COVID-19 medical device submitted.</p>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. This new virus and disease were unknown before theoutbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 has been known to cause respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, COVID-19 infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>
			<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic related to COVID-19. Most people recover from the disease without needing special treatment, however, it appears that around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.</p>
			<p>The <em>Interim Order</em> and this guidance document have been developed to ensure that medical devices that are integral to the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of COVID-19 can be quickly authorized for sale or importation in order to address the urgent public health need.</p>
			<h3>Purpose/overview</h3>
			<p>Health Canada has developed this guidance document in order to support the <em>Interim Order Respecting the Importation and Sale of Medical Devices for Use in Relation to COVID-19</em> pursuant to subsection 30.1(1) of the <em>Food and Drugs Act</em>. This <em>Interim Order</em> will allow the Department to issue expedited authorization for sale or import of medical devices to deal with the current significant risk of COVID-19 to the health and safety of Canadians.</p>
			<h3>Scope and application</h3>
			<p>This guidance document is intended to provide guidance to manufacturers to organize and submit an application in a timely manner for the sale or importation of medical devices that are manufactured, sold or represented for use in relation to COVID-19. This includes a medical device that is part of a system, test kit, medical device group, medical device family or medical device group family as defined in the <em>Medical Devices Regulations</em>.</p>
			<p>Devices that meet the definition of a COVID-19 medical device as defined in the <em>Interim Order</em>, must clearly indicate its direct use in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the active role the device plays in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.</p>
			<p>The guidance document also outlines manufacturers’ responsibility to report incidents relating to COVID-19 medical devices to Health Canada, as soon as they become aware of them. It also provides information on what the responsibilities are of manufacturers of COVID-19 medical devices should they need to recall a device approved through this mechanism.</p>
			<h3>Policy objectives</h3>
			<p>To provide assistance to manufacturers in preparing the documentation necessary to obtain authorization for the sale or importation of a COVID-19 medical device under <em>Interim Order Respecting the Importation and Sale of Medical Devices for Use in Relation to COVID-19</em>.</p>
			<h3>Authorization for import or sale</h3>
			<p>The <em>Interim Order Respecting the Importation and Sale of Medical Devices for Use in Relation to COVID-19</em> provides COVID-19 medical device manufacturers an exemption from the requirements under Part 1 of the Medical Devices Regulations, provided they have received an authorization for the importation or sale from Health Canada.</p>
			<p>When Health Canada determines that there is an urgent public health need for the importation or sale of a COVID-19 medical device, the manufacturer may submit an application for authorization under the <em>Interim Order</em> (Appendix A). For traceability purposes, Health Canada is issuing the authorization to manufacturers of COVID-19 medical devices, not to importers or distributors. If an authorization is granted, the manufacturer may import or sell their COVID-19 device in Canada. The manufacturer’s information and device information on the device label can then be cross-referenced against the authorization during importation and distribution, along with the letter of authorization that is required to accompany the product during import. The Minister may also decide to issue an expanded indication for use to a device that has either been approved through this <em>Interim Order</em>, or a device that was granted a Medical Device Licence.</p>
		</details>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2 id="expanded-use">Medical devices authorized for expanded use</h2>
			<p>Sections 13-15 of the <em>Interim Order</em> allow the Minister to grant an expanded indication for use or intended use, to include COVID-19 related diagnostic, treatment, mitigation or prevention claims based on known evidence. This expansion may be applied to COVID-19 medical devices authorized under this <em>Interim Order</em>, or to medical devices licensed under the <em>Medical Devices Regulations</em>.</p>
			<p>When the Minister decides to issue an expanded use indication, it will make information publically available, related to the device approved and the new indication.&nbsp; This will then be published to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/announcements/interim-order-importation-sale-medical-devices-covid-19/list-expanded-use.html">List of medical devices for expanded use in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, if the Minister believes that a medical device authorization holder has any information in relation to the proposed expanded use of the licensed medical device or the COVID-19 medical device, the Minister may request that information and the authorization holder must provide it.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2 id="importation">Importation of devices authorized under IO require a copy of the authorization</h2>
		<p>Importers and distributors do not require Medical Device Establishment Licences (MDELs) to import and sell COVID-19 medical devices that have been granted authorization under the <em>Interim Order</em>. Each shipment of a COVID-19 medical device that is imported into Canada must be accompanied by a copy of the <em>Interim Order</em> authorization. This document will be issued to the applicant upon authorization and will facilitate transport of the COVID-19 medical device(s) across the border, as it will be used as a signal that the device has been authorized under this Interim Order. Importers should rely on this mechanism to demonstrate to Health Canada that a shipment containing COVID-19 medical device should be allowed access into Canada.</p>
