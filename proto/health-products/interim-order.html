		<p>Manufacturers and importers are required to submit an application to Health Canada for the purpose of obtaining authorization to sell or import a COVID-19 medical device.</p>

	<section>
		<h2 id="activities">Devices expedited by applications under the Interim Order</h2>
		<p>The <em>Interim Order</em> provides an expedited authorization pathway for </p>
		<ol class="lst-lwr-rmn">
			<li>new COVID-19-medical devices that are not yet licensed in Canada or other jurisdictions, </li>
			<li>for COVID-19-related uses for existing devices licensed under the <em>Medical Device Regulations</em>, or under this <em>Interim Order</em>, and </li>
			<li>for COVID-19 medical devices that leverage an authorization of a device from a trusted foreign regulatory authority, whereby the Minister would maintain the ability to request additional information on a case-by-case basis.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This expedited authorization for sale or import is not intended to apply to devices which are currently licensed, or which were previously licensed in Canada, but the licence was suspended on the grounds of safety or effectiveness concerns.</p>
		<p>Note: The authorization for importation and sale is only valid for as long as the <em>Interim Order</em> is in effect, for a period of up to one year, unless it is renewed. </p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2 id="importation">Importation of devices authorized under IO require a copy of the authorization</h2>
		<p>Each shipment of a COVID-19 medical device imported into Canada must be accompanied by a copy of an authorization to import. This document will be issued to the applicant upon authorization and will facilitate transport of the COVID-19 medical device(s) across the border, as it will be used as a signal that the device has been authorized under this <em>Interim Order</em>.</p>
