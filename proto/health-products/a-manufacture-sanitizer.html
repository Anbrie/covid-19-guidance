  <h2>You must apply for a site licence</h2>
  
  <p>To obtain authorization to produce and sell hand sanitizers</h2>

  <h3>In Canada</h3>
  
  <p>Manufacturers  of alcoholic beverages and other alcohol producers may apply for an  authorization to manufacture and sell alcohol-based hand sanitizers through the  Expedited Access process. We have developed a <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/covid-19-expediated-licensing-alcohol-hand-sanitizer.html">step-by-step  guide</a> to walk applicants through this process. </p>
  
	<p>Under  the Expedited Access process, manufacturers will be required to:</p>
	
  <ul>
	<li>submit a product licence application to support the safety,       efficacy and quality of their alcohol-based hand sanitizer <strong>and</strong></li>
	<li>provide a <a href="/content/canadasite/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/covid-19-expediated-licensing-alcohol-hand-sanitizer/hand-sanitizer-eng.pdf">cover letter</a> with attestation that the site being used to manufacture, package,       and/or import their product meets acceptable good manufacturing practices </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Interested  companies should follow the instructions outlined in the <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/covid-19-expediated-licensing-alcohol-hand-sanitizer.html">Guide on Health Canada’s interim expedited licensing approach  for the production and distribution of alcohol-based hand sanitizers</a>.<br>
	For  information on the use of ethanol as an ingredient in alcohol-based sanitizers,  please see the <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/natural-non-prescription/legislation-guidelines/guidance-documents/covid19-ethanol-alcohol-hand-sanitizers.html">interim guide  on the production of ethanol for use in alcohol-based hand sanitizers&nbsp;</a>.</p>
	
  <p>Hand sanitizers authorized through this process are added to the <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html">list  of approved hand sanitizers</a>. The list is  updated daily, Monday to Friday. Companies are required to maintain records to  facilitate product recalls if needed.</p>
  
	<p>If  you have any questions on the application process, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hc.nnhpd-dpnso.sc@canada.ca">hc.nnhpd-dpnso.sc@canada.ca</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Expedited access </h3>
	
	<p>The  expedited access measure allows importers to supply sanitizers  or disinfectants that:</p>
  <ul>
	<li>do not fully  meet Health Canada requirements <strong>or</strong></li>
	<li>are authorized  or registered in other jurisdictions where the regulatory frameworks and  quality assurances are similar</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Under this  measure, importers must:</p>
  
  <ul>
	<li>notify Health Canada       prior to importing</li>
	<li>keep records in the event       of a <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/recalls/guidance-drug-natural-health-products/document.html">product       recall</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Contact  Health Canada by email at <a href="mailto:hc.covid19healthproducts-produitsdesante.sc@canada.ca">hc.covid19healthproducts-produitsdesante.sc@canada.ca</a> to receive an attestation form to complete. </p>
  
	<p>This  attestation form will enable Health Canada to work with the Canada Border  Services Agency to facilitate importation. The information provided will allow  authorities to take any necessary action if the product is considered to pose a  health risk.</p>
