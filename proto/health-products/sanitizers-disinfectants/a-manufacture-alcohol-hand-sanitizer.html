  </ul>
  <h2>Good Manufacturing Practices</h2>
  <ul>
	<li>For the purposes of this interim measure, any of the following GMP standards are considered acceptable. The standard to which you are attesting for your application will need to be selected in the&nbsp;<a href="/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/covid-19-expediated-licensing-alcohol-hand-sanitizer/hand-sanitizer-eng.pdf" rel="external">cover letter</a>:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2003-196/page-5.html#h-700670">Part 3 of the NHPR</a></li>
	  <li><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/c.r.c.%2C_c._870/page-114.html#h-576174">Division 2 of the&nbsp;<em>Food and Drug Regulations</em></a></li>
	  <li><a href="https://www.inspection.gc.ca/food-safety-for-industry/archived-food-guidance/non-federally-registered/safe-food-production/guide/eng/1352824546303/1352824822033">Guide to Food Safety</a>, or</li>
	  <li><a href="/en/health-canada/services/consumer-product-safety/cosmetics/regulatory-information/good-manufacturing-practices.html">Good Manufacturing Practices for Cosmetic Products*</a></li>
	</ul>
  </ul>
  <p>* Note: Health Canada encourages all cosmetic manufacturers to follow GMP, and has endorsed the use of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iso.org/" title="ISO - International Organization for Standardization (external link)" rel="external">International Standards Organization</a>&nbsp;(ISO) Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices for Cosmetics, ISO Standard 22716.</p>
  <ul>
	<li>Given the interim nature of the site licences issued under this interim measure, certain GMP requirements that are usually required for NHPs are waived during this period, specifically:
	  <ul>
		<li>Stability testing is <strong>not</strong> required</li>
		<li>A quality assurance report or other forms of evidence required as part of the standard process is <strong>not</strong> required</li>
		<li>For products containing more than 50% alcohol, finished product testing for microbiological contaminants is <strong>not</strong> required</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Regardless of the GMP standard selected, appropriate controls must be in place to avoid contamination throughout the entire manufacturing and packaging process.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The completed&nbsp;<a href="/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/covid-19-expediated-licensing-alcohol-hand-sanitizer/hand-sanitizer-eng.pdf" rel="external">cover letter</a>&nbsp;and <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/natural-non-prescription/applications-submissions/site-licensing/forms/site-licence-application-form-site-licensing.html">Site Licence Application Form</a> are to be submitted via the ePost conversation created for this purpose within the ePost Connect™ site.</p>
  <p>If the application meets all requirements outlined above, Health Canada will issue a site licence.</p>
  <p>Site licences issued as described in this guide will remain valid only while the interim measure is in effect.</p>
  <p>Following this period, if you wish to maintain a valid site licence to produce NHPs, the supporting evidence mentioned above (e.g. quality assurance report, stability testing, finished product testing) will be required as per the <abbr title="Natural Health Products Regulations">NHPR</abbr>, and the site will be required to meet the GMP standards outlined in Part 3 of the <abbr title="Natural Health Products Regulations">NHPR</abbr>.</p>
