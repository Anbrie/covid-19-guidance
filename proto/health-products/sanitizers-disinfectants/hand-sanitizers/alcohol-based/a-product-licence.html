  <h2>You require a product licence</h2>
<p>Before applying for a product licence:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you do not have a company code issued by Health Canada, send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hc.nnhpd-dpsnso.sc@canada.ca">hc.nnhpd-dpsnso.sc@canada.ca</a>, with the subject line "<strong>COVID-19 - Request for a company code</strong>". In the body of the email, include the company information to be included in your web Product Licence Application Form, including the company name, company address, contact information, and senior official.</li>
  <li>Health Canada will send the company code via email and initiate an ePost conversation with the applicant through ePost Connect™. If you do not have an ePost Connect™ account, register with Canada Post to open an account by following the instructions in the conversation notification e-mail.</li>
  <li>Complete the cover letter and the Product Licence Application Form, and submit both via the ePost conversation within the ePost Connect™ site.</li>
</ol>
<p>For different packaging sizes, only one application is required if the product formula and dosage form are the same. To complete the Product Licence Application Form, please follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>Access the web&nbsp;<a href="https://nnhpd-pla-dlmm-dpsnso.hc-sc.gc.ca/pla-dlmm/en/landing">Product Licence Application</a>&nbsp;Form. You may begin to fill the application form while you are waiting for your company code to be provided, by selecting the "Table of Contents" button at the bottom of the page, which will open the other sections to be completed. The form must be completed in its entirety before submitting, but you may complete it by going back and entering the company code once received.</p>
<ol class="lst-lwr-alph">
  <li>Under Application Type, select "<strong>Compendial</strong>" and select "<strong>Antiseptic Hand Cleansers</strong>" from the drop-down list of monographs.</li>
  <li>For "Is this formulation hypothetical", indicate "<strong>no</strong>". No reference submission or master file is required.</li>
  <li>For the "Primary Brand Name", please indicate a <strong>generic descriptor of the product and alcohol content</strong>, e.g. "Company name-Ethanol sanitizer 80%". Do not include any references to viruses including "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" or "coronavirus", diseases, or infectious conditions as these are outside of the <strong>Antiseptic Skin Cleansers monograph</strong>.</li>
  <li>Under "Dosage Form", select the appropriate dosage form for your product, such as <strong>"Gel", "Solution", "Liquid" or "Aerosol (spray)"</strong>.</li>
  <li>For "Sterile?", select <strong>"no"</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the "Medicinal Ingredient" page, select the applicable type of alcohol to be incorporated in your product, by proceeding as per <strong>one</strong> of the following instructions:
    <ul>
      <li>Search for <strong>"Ethanol"</strong> or <strong>"Ethyl Alcohol"</strong> and add it as a "Medicinal Ingredient". Once added, click on <strong>"Modify"</strong>, and indicate a concentration <strong>between 60-80%</strong> in the "Quantity per Dosage Unit" field.<br>
        OR</li>
      <li>Search for <strong>"Isopropanol"</strong> or <strong>"Isopropyl Alcohol"</strong>, and add it as a "Medicinal Ingredient". Once added, click on <strong>"Modify"</strong>, and indicate a concentration <strong>between 60-75%</strong> in the "Quantity per Dosage Unit" field.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add any acceptable "Non-Medicinal Ingredients" (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) to the list, as applicable.
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/search-rechercheReq.do?lang=eng">Natural Health Products Ingredient Database</a> (NHPID) includes a listing of acceptable ingredients, which can be used in the product formulation. This includes denaturants, which reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate ingestion.</li>
      <li>The use of denaturants, including <a href="http://was-int-01/nhpid-bdipsn-internal/ingredReq.do?id=917&amp;lang=eng" rel="external">Denatonium benzoate</a>, <a href="http://was-int-01/nhpid-bdipsn-internal/ingredReq.do?id=506&amp;lang=eng" rel="external">Sucrose octaacetate</a> and <a href="http://was-int-01/nhpid-bdipsn-internal/ingredReq.do?id=12872&amp;lang=eng" rel="external">t-Butyl alcohol</a>, is recommended but is not required under this interim measure. However, once this interim measure ceases to be in effect, you may receive a request from Health Canada to confirm that denaturants will be used in the manufacture of all hand sanitizer products from that point on.</li>
      <li>If you are following the <a href="https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf" rel="external">World Health Organization-recommended handrub formulations</a> and use a final concentration of 0.125% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide and 1.45% (v/v) glycerol, and water, please indicate so in this "Non-Medicinal Ingredients" section.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select the desired "Recommended uses" or "Purposes" from the drop-down list by checking the applicable boxes. They must match exactly the wording of the monograph.</li>
  <li>Add any desired "Subpopulation(s)" from the drop-down list.</li>
  <li>Add the following "Directions for Use" statements:
    <ul>
      <li>For all products:

          <li>"Supervise children when they use this product"</li>
          <li>"For occasional and personal domestic use"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For products intended as handrubs or wipes, also add:
        <ul>
          <li>"Rub thoroughly into hands for at least 30 seconds. Allow to dry"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For products intended as handwashes, also add:
        <ul>
          <li>"Lather in hands with water for at least 30 seconds. Rinse well"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No "Duration of Use" statement (e.g., "For use beyond X days, see a health care practitioner") is required.</li>
  <li>All "Cautions and Warnings" statements listed in the <a href="http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq.do?atid=antiseptic_antiseptique&amp;lang=eng">monograph</a> are required.</li>
  <li>Once the form is completed, a label text will be generated for the product:
    <ul>
      <li>Provide the "Net Quantity" in the packaged final product (numerical value and units such as mL, L).</li>
      <li>"Security features" (e.g., plastic bottle seal cap) are not required for these products under this interim measure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Before completing the form, carefully review the "Summary" and read the "Attestation" at the bottom of the page. To sign the "Attestation", select the "I agree" checkbox. This will generate an attestation code confirming that you accept the terms of the attestation. After agreeing with the attestation, the "Finalize" button will appear. Click on "Finalize" to lock the form, generate a unique tracking number and go to the "Finalized View".</p>
<p>The "Finalized View" includes the tracking number, a summary of the application and a signed attestation. Once completed, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/covid-19-expediated-licensing-alcohol-hand-sanitizer/hand-sanitizer-eng.pdf" rel="external">cover letter</a>&nbsp;and application form (in.html format) must be submitted via the ePost conversation. The application form is not sent automatically to Health Canada. If the application meets all requirements outlined above, Health Canada will issue a product licence.</p>
<h2>Use of domestic hand sanitizer in other settings</h2>
<p>A product licence issued under this interim measure allows for the use of the product for antibacterial&nbsp;hand sanitizing in a personal (domestic) setting. However, Health Canada recognizes that healthcare institutions, such as hospitals or clinics, or other commercial settings may be experiencing shortages and, in this context, may wish to access these products.&nbsp;<strong>Given the COVID-19 pandemic, and as part of this interim measure, a product authorized for personal use can be distributed to healthcare and commercial settings.</strong> To do so, companies must notify Health Canada by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hc.nnhpd-dpsnso.sc@canada.ca">hc.nnhpd-dpsnso.sc@canada.ca</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A subject line of "<strong>COVID-19 product notification</strong>"</li>
  <li>In the body of the email, information on the product (i.e., provide the product name and NPN) and its intended distribution (for example, hospitals)</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies must submit the e-mail notification prior to distribution but do not require a response from Health Canada.</p>
<p>As these products have not met the evidence requirements for higher risk uses in a general healthcare setting or as pre-surgical scrubs, these products must be labelled for personal use only.</p>
<p>Should a company wish to obtain approval to label their product for use by health professionals, for uses such as pre-surgical scrubs, or make explicit claims related to COVID-19, additional evidence must be submitted to support safety and efficacy. For more information on these types of applications, please refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/natural-health-products/legislation-guidelines/guidance-documents/management-product-licence-applications-attestations.html">Health Canada's <abbr title="natural health product">NHP</abbr> Management of Applications Policy</a>.</p>
