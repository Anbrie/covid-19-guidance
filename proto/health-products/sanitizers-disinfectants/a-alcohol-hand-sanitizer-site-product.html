  <h2>You require both a site licence and product licence</h2>
  <h2>Companies applying for both a product licence and a site licence</h2>
<p>To facilitate timely access to safe hand sanitizers during the period within which this interim measure is in effect, Health Canada is further simplifying the application process in cases where both a site licence and a product licence are required.</p>
<p>If your company is seeking both a product licence and a site licence, you may apply by&nbsp;<strong>only completing the Product Licence Application Form accompanied by a</strong> <a href="/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/covid-19-expediated-licensing-alcohol-hand-sanitizer/hand-sanitizer-eng.pdf" rel="external"><strong>cover letter</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The information contained in the&nbsp;<a href="/content/dam/hc-sc/documents/services/drugs-health-products/drug-products/applications-submissions/guidance-documents/covid-19-expediated-licensing-alcohol-hand-sanitizer/hand-sanitizer-eng.pdf" rel="external">cover letter</a>&nbsp;will provide sufficient information to support the site licence application, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The relevant industry (i.e., the current line of business of the applicant, such as distillery, or cosmetics).</li>
  <li>The intent of the application (i.e., sanitizer product + COVID-19 site licence);</li>
  <li>The GMP standard that is being met.</li>
  <li>The activities to be performed (e.g. manufacturing, packaging, labelling, and/or importing).</li>
  <li>The signature from a senior official.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labelling requirements</h3>
<p>This section outlines the applicable labelling requirements for a marketed product to comply with the regulatory requirements found in Part 3 of the <abbr title="Natural Health Products Regulations">NHPR</abbr>.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-27/"><em>Food and Drugs Act</em></a>, it is illegal to label, sell or advertise a product, including hand sanitizers, in a false, misleading or deceptive manner. Labelling must be compliant with the product licence; in this case, the claims made must be consistent <strong>(verbatim)</strong> with what is provided in the <a href="http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/atReq.do?atid=antiseptic_antiseptique&amp;lang=eng">Antiseptic Skin Cleansers monograph</a>. Authorization under this monograph does not permit any specific references to "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" or "coronavirus".</p>
<p>Product licence holders are responsible for ensuring that the label complies with the labelling requirements set out in <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2003-196/page-11.html#h-701030">Part 5 of the NHPR</a>, specifically Sections <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2003-196/page-11.html#h-701088">94</a>, <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2003-196/page-12.html#h-701107">95</a>, and <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2003-196/page-12.html#h-701117">97</a>, if applicable. As per <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2003-196/page-11.html#h-701035">sections 86(1) and 87(1)</a>, you are not allowed to sell an <abbr title="natural health product">NHP</abbr> unless it is packaged and labelled in accordance with the <abbr title="Natural Health Products Regulations">NHPR</abbr>. A checklist is provided below that itemizes the elements required on the label and their location (if specified).</p>
<p>Label information must be presented in both official languages (French and English) under the NHPR 87(1).</p>
<div class="well">

<h3>Adverse reaction reporting</h3>
<p>As with any health product, an adverse reaction may occur with the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Product licence holders are required to report serious adverse reactions that occur in Canada as well as serious adverse reactions that occur internationally. You must report any adverse reactions to Health Canada within 15 days of receiving the information or risk potential compliance and enforcement actions.</p>
<p>This mandatory reporting is done through Health Canada's <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medeffect-canada/canada-vigilance-program.html">Canada Vigilance Program</a>.<br>
  Once you have a licence, you must submit adverse reaction reports as noted above and select the "Natural Health Products" box.</p>
<p>You can find additional information on reporting adverse reactions in the <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/reports-publications/medeffect-canada/reporting-adverse-reactions-marketed-health-products-guidance-industry.html">Reporting Adverse Reactions to Marketed Health Products - Guidance Document for Industry.</a></p>
<h3>End of interim measure</h3>
<p>Health Canada will lift the interim measure when the regular supply stabilizes.</p>
<h3>Questions?</h3>
<p>If you have questions regarding the licensing of alcohol-based hand sanitizers or sites that are not addressed in this document, you can contact Health Canada's Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate at <a href="mailto:hc.nnhpd-dpsnso.sc@canada.ca">hc.nnhpd-dpsnso.sc@canada.ca</a>.</p>
<p>Given the manner in which Health Canada is processing applications as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, we would ask that you refrain from contacting the department for status updates on your applications. If your application is deficient, Health Canada will communicate with you directly via the ePost account. Applicants are advised to monitor their ePost account closely, including the junk folder.</p>
