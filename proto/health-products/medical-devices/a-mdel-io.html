	<h2>You require either a Medical Device Establishment Licence (MDEL) or Interim Order Authorization</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<h3>Option 1: Medical Device Establishment Licence (MDEL)</h3>
		<p>Health Canada is expediting the review and issuance of Medical Device Establishment Licences (MDELs) for companies requesting to manufacture Class I, or import or distribute Class I to IV medical devices in relation to COVID-19.</p>
		<p>Important information about MDELs:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Manufacturers, importers and distributors of medical devices must have an MDEL before they can import or sell in Canada. The exceptions to holding an MDEL include:
				<ul>
					<li>manufacturers that have been granted authorization under the interim order for importing and selling medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19</li>
					<li>importers or distributors that import or sell a medical device for which the manufacturer has been granted authorization for that device under the interim order for importing and selling medical devices</li>
					<li>manufacturers of Class I medical devices that import or distribute solely through a person that holds an MDEL</li>
					<li>retailers and health care facilities, as they do not need an MDEL</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>An MDEL application form is required</li>
			<li>The fee to apply is $4,590, but the MDEL holder can qualify for a fee mitigation</li>
			<li>MDEL holders can sell, import or distribute multiple types of medical devices under 1 licence.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>To submit an MDEL application</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Review <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/establishment-licences/directives-guidance-documents-policies/guidance-medical-device-establishment-licensing-0016.html">Guidance 0016: Medical device establishment licensing and medical device establishment licensing fees</a>.</li>
			<li>Complete the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/compliance-enforcement/establishment-licences/forms/medical-device-establishment-licence-application-form-instructions-0292.html">MDEL application form (FRM-0292)</a></li>
			<li>Email the completed MDEL application form to</li>
			<li class="well list-unstyled">E-mail: <a href="mailto:hc.mdel.application.leim.sc@canada.ca?subject=URGENT - COVID-19 - MDEL application for - [name of company]">hc.mdel.application.leim.sc@canada.ca</a><br>Subject line: URGENT - COVID-19 - MDEL application for - [name of company]</li>
		</ol>
		<p>For any questions related to the MDEL process, please email <a href="mailto:hc.mdel.questions.leim.sc@canada.ca">hc.mdel.questions.leim.sc@canada.ca</a>.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>OR</p>
	<blockquote>
		<h3>Option 2: Interim order authorization to import and sell medical devices related to COVID-19</h3>
		<p>Alternatively, you can apply for authorization under the interim order to import and sell medical devices related to COVID-19 , which allows Health Canada to carry out expedited evaluations of applicable applications but this will not remain valid after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
		<p>Important information about this pathway:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>This pathway is intended for manufacturers of all classes of devices, including Class I devices such as medical masks or gowns that are not approved in Canada</li>
			<li>Manufacturers submit an abbreviated application to support the safety, effectiveness and quality of their medical device</li>
			<li>Health Canada will conduct a scientific review before authorizing the sale of these devices</li>
			<li>No fees apply to this pathway</li>
			<li>Manufacturers that receive an authorization for Class I devices under this pathway are not required to obtain a Medical Device Establishment Licence (MDEL)</li>
			<li>If a manufacturer receives an IO authorization, importers and distributors do not need to obtain an MDEL to import or distribute the device in Canada</li>
			<li>The application covers a single medical device product. Separate IO authorizations are required for each product</li>
			<li>Medical devices authorized through this pathway are published in the  lists of devices authorized under the IO </li>
		</ul>
