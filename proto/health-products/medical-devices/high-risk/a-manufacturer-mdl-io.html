	<h2>You do not require authorization but the manufacturer does</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<h3>Option 1: Manufacturer applies for authorization under the Interim Order</h3>
		<p>The manufacturer can apply for authorization under the Interim Order, which allows expedited access to COVID-19-related medical devices. It applies to manufacturers of Class I to IV medical devices.</p>
		<p>Under the IO, manufacturers will be required to submit an abbreviated application to support the safety, effectiveness and quality of their medical device. The fees associated with an application through the IO pathway will be waived. In addition, manufacturers applying through this pathway will not be required to hold a MDSAP certification. This is the most effective pathway manufacturers should be following in order to apply for authorization.</p>	
		<p><a href="../../interim-order.html" class="btn btn-call-to-action">Apply for authorization under the Interim Order</a></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>OR</p>
	<blockquote>
		<h3>Option 2: Manufacturer applies for an Medical Device Licence for the medical device</h3>
		<p>Manufacturers of Class II, III, and IV medical devices are required to hold a medical device licence (MDL) for the sale and importation of their medical device into Canada. The MDL pathway is open to manufacturers of COVID-19 medical devices who hold a valid MDSAP certificate and wish to market their medical device beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
		<p>Under the MDL pathway, manufacturers must submit an application form, a MDSAP certificate, labelling and technical documentation (Class III & IV devices). Your submission should be prepared according to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medical-devices/application-information/guidance-documents/international-medical-device-regulators-forum.html">Table of Contents</a> (ToC) folder structure. For more information, please access our <a href="https://training-formation.phac-aspc.gc.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=42&lang=en">Device Advice e-Learning Tool</a> which thoroughly describes the premarket regulatory requirements for medical devices in Canada.</p>
