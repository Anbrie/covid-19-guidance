	<h2>You and/or the manufacturer require authorization</h2>

	<blockquote>
		<h4>Option 1: Manufacturer applies for authorization under the Interim Order</h4>
		<p>The manufacturer can apply for authorization under the Interim Order, which allows expedited access to COVID-19-related medical devices. It applies to manufacturers of Class I to IV medical devices.</p>
		<p>You will not require an MDEL to distribute the device authorised under the Interim Order during the COVID-19 pandemic if the device is authorized under the Interim Order.</p>	
	</blockquote>
	<p>OR</p>
	<blockquote>
		<h3>Option 2: Manufacturer applies for an Medical Device Licence and you apply for a Medical Device Establishment Licence</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Step 1: Manufacturer applies for an Medical Device Licence for the medical device</h4>
			<p>Unless licensed during the pandemic under an Interim Order Authorization, manufacturers of Class II, III, and IV medical devices are required to hold a medical device licence (MDL) for the sale and importation of their medical device into Canada. The MDL pathway is open to manufacturers of COVID-19 medical devices who hold a valid MDSAP certificate and wish to market their medical device beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

				<p>MDEL applications are being expedited during COVID-19.</p>
			</div>
		
			<p>Important information about MDELs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Manufacturers, importers and distributors of medical devices must have an MDEL before they can import or sell in Canada. The exceptions to holding an MDEL include:
					<ul>
						<li>manufacturers that have been granted authorization under the interim order for importing and selling medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19</li>
						<li>importers or distributors that import or sell a medical device for which the manufacturer has been granted authorization for that device under the interim order for importing and selling medical devices</li>
						<li>manufacturers of Class I medical devices that import or distribute solely through a person that holds an MDEL</li>
						<li>retailers and health care facilities, as they do not need an MDEL</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>An MDEL application form is required</li>
				<li>The fee to apply is $4,590, but the MDEL holder can qualify for a fee mitigation</li>
				<li>MDEL holders can sell, import or distribute multiple types of medical devices under 1 licence.</li>
			</ul>
