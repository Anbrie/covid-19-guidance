	<h2>You require authorization or licencing</h2>

		<h3>Option 1: Apply for authorization under the Interim Order</h3>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
			<p>Expedited process during COVID-19</p>
			<p>You must apply for authorization for each type of device you manufacture, and Interim Order authorizations will expire once the COVID-19 pandemic ends.</p>
		</div>	
		<p>You should apply for authorization under the Interim Order, which allows expedited access to COVID-19-related medical devices. It applies to manufacturers of Class I to IV medical devices.</p>
		<p>Under the IO, manufacturers will be required to submit an abbreviated application to support the safety, effectiveness and quality of their medical device. The fees associated with an application through the IO pathway will be waived. This is the most effective pathway manufacturers should be following in order to apply for authorization.</p>
