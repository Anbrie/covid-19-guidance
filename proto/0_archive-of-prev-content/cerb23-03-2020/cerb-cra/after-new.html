    </ul>
    <p>To ensure you continue to receive the support you need, the Government of Canada is proposing to implement 3 new benefits: the Canada Recovery Benefit, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, and the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit. Service Canada is also temporarily changing the rules for Employment Insurance (EI).</p>
    
<h2 id="h1">Determine the right benefit for you</h2>
<p>If you continue to need income support after the CERB ends, first find out if you qualify for the new simplified Employment Insurance (EI) benefit, which will be available September 27, 2020.</p>
<p>For those not eligible for EI, such as self-employed and gig economy workers,  the new Canada Recovery Benefit will provide $800 (before taxes withheld) per 2-week period, for up to 26 weeks.</p>
		 <p>You may only apply for one Canada recovery benefit at a time for the same period.</p>		 
<h2 id="h2">EI or Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB)</h2>

<ol class="lst-stps">
<li><h3>First, determine if you qualify for Employment Insurance (EI)</h3>
<p>Service Canada is temporarily changing the EI rules to allow more people affected by COVID-19 to qualify.</p>
<p>You may get a minimum rate of $400 per week for up to 26 weeks.</p>
<details><summary>Review highlights of EI changes</summary>
<ul>
<li>You will now only need a minimum of 120 insurable hours (in which you paid into EI) for EI
regular benefits</li>
<li>You may get a minimum rate of $400 per week for up to 26 weeks</li>
<li>You can still work, but your benefit will reduce by $0.50 for every dollar you earn (up to
90% of previous weekly earning)</li>
<li>If you qualify for EI, you may apply for it as of September 27, 2020</li>
</ul>
  <!--<p>These changes are pending legislation passing in the House of Commons and Senate.</p>
  <p>More information will be available after that.</p>--> 
</details>
</li>
 
<li><h3>Second, if you don't qualify for EI, the proposed Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) may be right for you.</h3>
<p>The proposed CRB would provide income support to employed and self-employed individuals whose income is directly affected by COVID-19. This benefit would be for people who are ready to work and looking for work, but who <strong>do not qualify</strong> for the new Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.</p>
  <p>This benefit is pending legislation passing in the House of Commons and Senate.</p>

</li>
</ol>
  <h2 id="h3">Caregiving and sickness recovery benefits</h2>
  <p>If you’re not able to work due to your health or caregiving responsibilities related to COVID-19, you may be eligible for one of these other proposed  recovery benefits.</p>
	<p>You may only apply for one Canada recovery benefit at a time for the same period.</p>
    <p>These benefits are pending legislation passing in the House of Commons and Senate.</p>

<h3>Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB)</h3>
<p>The proposed CRCB would provide income support ($500 per week, for up to 26 weeks per household) to employed and self-employed individuals who are not able to work because they are caring for a young child or family member who requires supervised care. This only applies if their regular school, facility, or program is closed due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>For more information, go to <a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/crcb/onepager.html">Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB)</a>.</p>

<h3>Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)</h3>
<p>The proposed CRSB would provide $500 per week for up to 2 weeks, for employed and self-employed individuals who are not able to work because they’re sick or need to self-isolate due to COVID-19.</p>
