		    <h2 id="h1">Why you would send the CERB back</h2>
			    <p>You may want to return or repay the CERB if you received an overpayment. This could happen if you:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>return to work earlier than expected, or receive retroactive pay from your employer</li>
                     <li>applied for CERB but later realize you’re not eligible  </li>
			  <li>receive a CERB payment from both Service Canada and the CRA</li>
                  </ul>
		    
		    <details>
        <summary>If you applied for the CERB twice</summary>
                     <p>If you applied for the CERB or EI with Service Canada, and then later applied for the CERB with the CRA for the same period, you applied twice. If this happens, you will have to return or repay the overpayment.</p>
    </details>
		       <details>
        <summary>If your employer compensates you for the same eligibility period</summary>
                 <p>If you applied for the CERB in good faith, and you are later rehired, and your employer pays you back pay for the same period you collected the CERB, then you will need to repay the CERB for that period. </p>
    </details>
		    
		    <h2 id="h2">Repayment conditions</h2>
		    <p>The conditions around paying back the CERB are different if you’re paying back your first eligibility period, or a subsequent period.</p>
		    <details>
		    <summary>For your first eligibility period</summary>
<p>You will need to repay the $2,000 for this period if you earned or will earn more than $1,000 (before taxes) from employment or self-employment income 14 days in a row during this 4-week period.</p>
		    </details>
		    <details>
		    <summary>For subsequent eligibility periods</summary>
<p>You will need to repay the $2,000 for a eligibility period if you earned or will earn more than $1,000 (before taxes) from employment or self-employment income during that period.</p>
		    </details>


		    
		    <h2 id="h3">Impact on tax slips</h3>
		    <p>The CERB is taxable. You will receive a T4A tax slip on the amount of CERB you receive.</p>
		    <p>If you repay the CERB, the CRA won’t issue a T4A for that payment. To ensure that we don’t issue slips improperly, you need to repay your CERB <strong>before December 31, 2020</strong>.</p> 
		 <details>
                <summary>If you need more time to repay</summary>
                 <p>If you want to repay your CERB but need more time, <a href="contact.html">contact the CRA</a> to ensure you have an agreed upon payback schedule by December 31, 2020.</p>
