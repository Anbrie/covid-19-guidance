      <p>If you applied for the CERB or EI with Service Canada, and then later applied for the CERB with the CRA for the same eligibility period, you applied twice. If this happens, you will have to return or repay the overpayment.</p>
      <p class="h4">Do I have to repay my CERB if I get rehired or find a new job?</p>
      <p>You are required to repay the CERB if you no longer meet the eligibility requirements for the 4-week period in question. For example, you applied for the 4-week period of April 12 to May 9. At the time you applied, you expected to have little or no work or income for that 4-week period. But you have just found out your employer has rehired you and will give you back-pay for that same 4-week period. In this situation, you will need to repay the CERB for that 4-week period of April 12 to May 9.</p>
      <p class="h3 mrgn-tp-0">Repayment conditions</p>
      <p>The conditions around paying back the CERB are different if you’re paying back your first eligibility period, or a subsequent period.</p>
      <p class="h4">For your first eligibility period</p>
      <p>If your employment or self-employment income was $1,000 or less (before deductions) for at least 14 days in a row during this 4-week period, you do not need to repay the CERB.</p>
      <p class="h4">For subsequent eligibility periods</p>
      <p>You will need to repay the $2,000 for an eligibility period if you earned or will earn more than $1,000 (before deductions) from employment or self-employment income during that period.</p>

    <p>The CERB is taxable. You will receive a T4A tax slip on the amount of CERB you receive.</p>
    <p>If you repay the CERB, the CRA won’t issue a T4A for that payment. To ensure that we don’t issue slips improperly, you need to repay your CERB <strong>before December 31, 2020</strong>.</p>
