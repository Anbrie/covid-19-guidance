        <h3>Seeking work opportunities</h3>
          <p>The CERB is available to provide support to those who are unable to work due to COVID-19. Workers should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so. You are encouraged to consult <a href="https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/findajob/resources/cerb">Job Bank</a>, Canada’s national employment service that offers tools to help with your job search.</p>
          <h3 id="validate">Validating your application </h3>
          <p>The CRA is validating applications in order to maintain  public confidence in Canada’s tax system and ensure that payments are available  for people who need them most.</p>
          <p> We may need some more information before processing your  application. </p>
          <h4> If you need to validate your  application </h4>
          <p> If you receive a notice asking you to validate your  application, you must call the toll-free number provided in the notice.</p>
          <p> We may ask you to call us for any of the following reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Confirm the personal information we have on file</li>
            <li>Verify that you meet the eligibility criteria</li>
            <li>Review your account activity if we detect any  suspicious behaviour</li>
          </ul>
          <details>
            <summary>Before you call, have the following information on hand </summary>
            <ul>
              <li>Social Insurance Number (SIN)</li>
              <li>Full name and date of birth</li>
              <li>A copy of a government issued identification such as a license or passport</li>
              <li>Access to your CRA My Account, if applicable, or an assessed return, notice of assessment or reassessment, or other tax document</li>
            </ul>
          </details>
        <p>To complete our validation, we may also ask you to provide some additional documents as they apply to your situation.</p>

            <p>We may ask for the following documents</p></summary>

    	<h4>Reviewing your eligibility</h4>
    	<p>We will review the information we have in our records and  consider the supporting documents that you provide to establish your  eligibility.</p>
    	<p>	  We may contact third parties, including the document issuing  authorities, to authenticate the contents of the supporting documents you provide.</p>
    	<p>	  It can take 2 to 3 weeks to process your file from the date  we receive your complete response. We will contact you once the validation is  complete.</p>
    	<p>	  If  you received a CERB payment that you are not eligible for, we will contact you  to make arrangements to repay any amount you owe. Canadians can also report  suspected CERB misuse through the CRA <a href="https://canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html">Leads program</a>.</p>



    <h2 id="h-1">Re-apply for the CERB</h2>
    <p>To keep  receiving the CERB beyond a single 4-week period, you must re-apply. </p>
    <p>If you  continue to meet the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/apply-for-cerb-with-cra/who-apply.html#eligibility-criteria">eligibility criteria</a>, you may<strong> re-apply every 4 weeks</strong>, up to a maximum of 7 periods (or 28 weeks  in total). This means you can re-apply up to 3 times. The periods do not have to be consecutive.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>If you start working again and then stop</summary>
      <p>If you  started working again after you got the CERB, and then stopped working again in  a later period, you may be eligible to re-apply for the CERB.</p>
      <p>Your  re-application will be treated like a <strong>first-time  application</strong>. </p>
      <p>When you  re-apply for a period that does <strong>not</strong> immediately follow your previous  period, you must meet the eligibility criteria for a first-time application.</p>
      <p>Confirm <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/apply-for-cerb-with-cra/who-apply.html#eligibility-criteria">eligibility criteria</a></p>
