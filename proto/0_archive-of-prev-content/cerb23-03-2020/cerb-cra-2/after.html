	<p>If you continue to need income support after the CERB ends, you may qualify for Employment Insurance (EI) or the new Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) that
will be <strong>available soon</strong> (after the CERB ends on September 26).</p>




<h2 id="h2">EI or Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB)</h2>
<ol class="lst-stps">
<li><h3>First, determine if you qualify for Employment Insurance (EI)</h3>
<p>Service Canada is temporarily changing the EI rules to allow more people affected by
COVID-19 to qualify.</p>



<p>You may get a minimum rate of $400 per week for up to 26 weeks</p>


<details><summary>Review revised eligibility for EI</summary>
<ul>

</ul>

<p></p>
<p>If you qualify for EI, you may apply for it after September 27, 2020</p>


<p>More information coming soon.</p>

</li>
<li><h3>Second, if you don’t qualify for EI, the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) may be right for you.</h3>
  <p>The CRB will provide income support to workers who are self-employed or are <strong>not eligible</strong> for Employment Insurance (EI) </p>
  <p>This benefit is pending the passage of legislation in the House of Commons and Senate.</p>
