    <p>We  are providing an extra $300 per child through the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)  for 2019-20. This will mean approximately $550 more for the average family.</p>
    <p> This  benefit will be delivered as part of the scheduled CCB payment in May.</p>
    <p> <strong>Those who already receive the Canada  Child Benefit do not need to re-apply. </strong> </p>

    <p>
      The  average additional benefit will be close to $400 for single individuals and  close to $600 for couples. </p>
    <p> <strong>There is no need to apply for this payment. If you are eligible, you will get it automatically.</strong></p>

    <p>
      For  individuals (other than trusts), the return filing due date will be deferred  until June 1, 2020. &nbsp;</p>
    <p> We  will also allow any new income tax balances due, or  instalments, to be deferred until after August 31, 2020 without incurring  interest or penalties. </p>

    <h3 id="mortgage_support">Mortgage support</h3>
    <p>Canadian banks have committed to work with their customers on a  case-by-case basis to find solutions to help them manage hardships caused by  COVID-19. Canadians who are impacted by COVID-19 and experiencing financial  hardship as a result should contact their financial institution regarding  flexibility for a mortgage deferral. This allows flexibility to be available − when needed − to those who  need it the most. </p>

    <p><strong>Contact your financial  institution for further mortgage assistance.</strong></p>
    <p>The  Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and other mortgage insurers offer <a href="https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/finance-and-investing/mortgage-loan-insurance/the-resource/dealing-with-mortgage-payment-difficulties">tools to lenders</a> that can assist  homeowners who may be experiencing financial difficulty. These include payment  deferral, loan re-amortization, capitalization of outstanding interest arrears  and other eligible expenses, and special payment arrangements.</p>
  <p> Canada’s mortgage insurers are committed to providing homeowners  with solutions to mitigate temporary financial hardship related to COVID-19.  This includes permitting lenders to defer up to six monthly mortgage payments  (interest and principal) for impacted borrowers. Deferred payments are added to  the outstanding principal balance and subsequently repaid throughout the life  of the mortgage.</p>
