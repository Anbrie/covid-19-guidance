            <p>The Government of Canada has established quarantine facilities to prevent the

                who are unable to isolate or quarantine because they are unable to meet the conditions of the
                Order (e.g., live with a vulnerable person, do not have private transportation if they are
                symptomatic).</p>

            <p>These facilities are to be used as <strong>last resort</strong> for travellers who have no options of
                meeting quarantine requirements by other means.</p>
            <p>Transportation from the port of entry to the quarantine facility is provided by the Government of
                Canada. These measures help protect older adults and medically vulnerable people, who are at the
                greatest risk of severe COVID-19 disease.</p>

            Government and Manufacturing) and are required to provide their services within 14 days of their entry to Canada and have reasonable rationales for the

        <!-- <mark>this section about exemptions/letter of interpretation needs to incorporate Emily Felisatti's feedback/word doc - likely need a plain language review on the new content, make sure we don't loose sight of the call drivers, etc.</mark>

        <mark>Is her new content just about quarantine exemptions, or is the 'request for interpretation' also about 'travel restrictions' too? Another common call was 'unnecessary requests for letters, when someone was already clearly defined' I didn't have time to process it before I left, so leaving note for team. Another common call driver is 'how to ask to be exempt from quarantine' (and... most can't be). Seems only the piece and how her new content to quarantine exemptions belong on this page, but any 'travel exemption interpretation' belongs as part of the "Who can travel to Canada" page in some way. </mark> -->
<p>Although you may have a compassionate and compelling reason, you <strong>cannot</strong> be exempted from the 14 day quarantine for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a visit to a sick or dying relative in hospital or a long-term care facility</li>
    <li>attending a funeral</li>
    <li>cross-border child custody arrangements</li>
    <li>attending class as a cross-border student (exemptions no longer apply as of August 2020)</li>
    <li>non-essential reasons</li>
</ul>

<details><summary>How to request a letter of interpretation</summary>

<p id="request-ex">If you would like to request a letter of interpretation that provides an assessment as to whether your <strong>future</strong> travels <strong>may</strong> qualify for an exemption under one of the Emergency Orders under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>, please submit your request in writing to the Public Health Agency of Canada at: <a href="mailto:phac.emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca"
    target="_blank">emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca</a>.
</p>



<p>Note that there is currently a high volume of requests, and response times are delayed. <strong>Submit your request well in advance</strong> of your travel dates, as it can take up to a month or more to receive a response. </p>

<p>The response email may be presented to the government representative at the port of entry during <strong>your next crossing</strong> to facilitate their decision as to whether an exemption applies in your case. </p>

<p> To support a thorough analysis, include the following information, at minimum:</p>
<ul>
    <li>number of travellers and country of citizenship of each traveller</li>
    <li>planned travel dates/frequency of travel</li>
    <li>specific purpose for travel to Canada</li>
    <li>an explanation as to why you believe your travel to Canada qualifies for an exemption under the Emergency Orders. Include any relevant information to support the explanation. <strong>Do not include any personal or sensitive information</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for the development of the Emergency Orders pursuant to the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>, government representatives are responsible for administering the Emergency Orders at Canada’s ports of entry. </p>
<p>As such, permission to enter Canada, or exemption from quarantine, is granted by a government representative, who is required to consider the information provided at the time of entry to determine whether a person should be permitted entry into Canada, or be exempt from quarantine. This includes reviewing travel documentation (for example, a valid passport and work permit, a letter of invitation from an employer), the quarantine plan for the arriving traveller, and any relevant exemptions.</p>
<p>A letter of interpretation from PHAC would be taken into account, but would not guarantee entry or exemption from quarantine requirements.

<h2 id="complying">Complying with the Emergency Order</h2>
<p>The Government of Canada has put in place an <a
        href="https://orders-in-council.canada.ca/attachment.php?attach=39482&lang=en">Emergency Order</a> under the
    <cite><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Q-1.1/index.html">Quarantine Act</cite></a>. It applies to all travellers arriving in Canada. Its purpose is to slow the spread of
    COVID-19 in Canada.</p>

    <h3>Consequences for failure to comply with the Emergency Order</h3>

  <p>Providing false information is considered misrepresentation and has
    consequences. If you provide false immigration information or false
    information about the purpose of your travel, you may be denied entry
    and/or be banned from returning to Canada.</p>


    <p>Failure to comply with this order is an offence under the <em>Quarantine Act</em> and could lead to <strong>imprisonment and/or fines</strong>.</p>

<details>
<summary>Penalties, imprisonment and fines</summary>

<p>Violating any instructions provided to you when you entered Canada is an offence under the <em>Quarantine
        Act</em>
    and could lead to up to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>6 months in prison <strong>and/or</strong></li>
    <li>$750,000 in fines</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, a person who causes a risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm to another person while wilfully or
    recklessly contravening this act or the regulations could be liable for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a fine of up to $1,000,000 <strong>or</strong></li>
    <li>imprisonment of up to 3 years <strong>or</strong></li>
    <li>both</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Contraventions Act</em> has been changed to give police (including RCMP, provincial and local police)
    more
    power to enforce the <em>Quarantine Act</em>. They can now issue tickets to people who do not comply with the
    act.
    Fines range from $275 to $1000.</p>

<p>To better understand the roles and responsibilities of federal, provincial and territorial governments and law
    enforcement agencies with
    compliance and enforcement, see <a
        href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/covid/canadians-canadiens-eng.html#s3">Compliance and enforcement
