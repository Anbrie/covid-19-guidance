                  <li>a letter of acceptance from a designated learning institution</li>

               <p>If your application passes this first stage, we’ll let you know in your online account. This doesn’t guarantee
                  that we’ll approve your application and issue you a study permit.</p>

                  <li>any information that changed after we reviewed your application for eligibility</li>

               <p>If your application passes this second stage, we’ll approve it.</p>
