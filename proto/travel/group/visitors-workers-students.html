               <p>As a temporary worker, you’re exempt from travel restrictions if you’re coming for an essential
                  (non-discretionary) purpose.</p>
               
               
               <p>Certain people who can <strong><a href="#exempt">work without a permit</a></strong> may also be exempt from travel
                  restrictions. </p>

               <h3>Essential (non-discretionary) travel for a temporary worker</h3>
               <p><strong>Essential</strong> refers to travel for reasons that are non-discretionary and non-optional. The emergency
                  orders under the Quarantine Act do not allow people to travel to Canada for optional or discretionary reasons, such
                  as
                  for tourism, recreation or entertainment.</p>
               <p>As a worker, you can enter Canada if you’re in <strong>either</strong> of
                  these situations:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>You have a valid work permit and <strong>normally live in Canada</strong>.
                     <ul>

                  </li>
                  <li>You’re a worker who meets <strong>all</strong> of the following:
                     <ul>
                        <li>has a letter of introduction for a work permit (<strong>open or employer-specific</strong>) </li>
                        <li>has a valid job offer</li>
                        <li>can work once you enter Canada and complete your 14-day quarantine (unless you’re exempt)</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>

      <h3>Non essential (discretionary) travel for a temporary worker</h3>
                  <p>You cannot enter Canada if you’re in either of these situations: </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>You have a letter of introduction for an employer-specific work permit but your employer has closed their
                        business due to the COVID-19 outbreak. </li>
                     <li>You have a letter of introduction for an open work permit, but you don’t have a job contract and are planning
                        to
                        find a job once you arrive in Canada.</li>
