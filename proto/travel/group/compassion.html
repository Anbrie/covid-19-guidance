<p>In some cases, foreign nationals may enter Canada to provide non-medical care to family members, even if they aren't considered immediate family.</p>
               
               <p>We have strict travel measures in place to control the spread of COVID-19. Because of this, no one can guarantee you will be allowed to enter Canada. A government representative makes the <strong>final decision at the port of entry</strong> based on the information presented to them at the time.

   <p>You may be allowed to enter Canada to provide care for a family member if you have compelling evidence to prove your entry is not optional.
   <p>You will need to provide:</p>

      <li>a written letter from a doctor proving your family member requires care</li>
      <li>reasons why no other care option is possible</li>

<p>We recognize that this is a very difficult time for families who are facing grief and loss of loved ones.</p>
               
               <p>We have strict travel measures in place to control the spread of COVID-19. Because of this, no one can guarantee you will be allowed to enter Canada.

   <h3 id="funerals-US">Coming from the U.S. as a foreign national</h3>
               <p>Attending a funeral or sitting vigil isn't enough grounds to enter Canada at this time. You must provide compelling reasons why your entry is not optional. You must also explain how you plan to meet the 14-day <a href="isolation.html#quarantine">mandatory quarantine requirements</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of reasons why your entry is not optional:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>executor of the deceased's estate or will</li>
      <li>providing emotional support or care for remaining family in Canada</li>
      <li>any other details that may strengthen your case that your presence is necessary (including proof of your relationship to the person)</li>
   </ul>
               
 <p>Examples of meeting quarantine:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>you can complete the mandatory quarantine period before the funeral</li>
      <li>you have written permission to quarantine with the family member</li>
      <li>you'll be sitting vigil in a private setting (such as at the person's home)</li>
   </ul>


   <h3 id="funerals-nonUS">Coming from all other countries as a foreign national</h3>
   <p>You will have to request a family reunification certificate to be considered. To apply for one, you must be able to show that your presence in Canada is required to handle any family affairs.
