<p>You cannot enter Canada to provide:</p>
<ul>
   <li>childcare for your relatives</li>
   <li>support when your family member is already in a healthcare facility or has other healthcare support</li>
   <!-- <li>what else?</li>-->
</ul>

<p>You may still be able to enter Canada to reunite with immediate family.</p>
