                facility where you must remain for 14 days. Before travellers are transferred to an isolation site government representatives will work with them to confirm that

            <p>If you can come to Canada and <strong>you have no symptoms</strong>, you must <strong>quarantine</strong> (self-isolate) for 14 days.

           <h3 id="plan">Your quarantine plan</h3>

        <p>As a traveller, you <strong>must</strong> demonstrate that you have an adequate plan for quarantine. You
            are expected to make plans, within your own means, in advance of your arrival at ports of entry to Canada. <strong>Foreign nationals</strong> who do not have a plan may be denied entry into Canada.</p>

<details>
    <summary>Where can you quarantine (self-isolate)</summary>

    <ul>
        <li>You must quarantine in a place where you won't have contact with people who:
            <ul>
                <li>are 65 years or older</li>
                <li>have underlying medical conditions</li>
                <li>have a compromised immune system</li>

        </li>
     <li>You'll need access to the basic necessities of life, including water, food and medication</li>
    </ul>
        <p>You may only quarantine with somebody from the above group if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they consent to the quarantine or are the parent or minor in a parent-minor relationship</li>
                <li>you complete a form provided by a government representative at the port of entry explaining the consent and

   <p>Many travellers will be able to quarantine at home or at their Canadian destination.</p>

   <p>Some travellers may be unable to quarantine at home or their final destination. In these cases, travellers are expected to
    make alternative arrangements for their return to Canada. Although alternate accommodations (e.g. with family or
    friends, or paid accommodation) may be suitable, the Government of Canada does not reimburse for expenses incurred for
    accommodations, including hotels, RV rentals and trailer park or campground fees.</p>

    <details><summary>Using hotels</summary>
       <p>If you are not displaying symptoms, you may be allowed to quarantine at a hotel. A government of Canada representative
          can give you instructions. While staying at a hotel, you must:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>stay in your room to avoid contact with others</li>
          <li>practise physical distancing (maintain a 2-metre distance)</li>
          <li>practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette at all times</li>
       </ul>
       <p>To get a meal, use
          a delivery service and ask that the meal be left outside the door of your hotel room.</p>

<details><summary>How to request a letter of interpretation</summary>

<p id="request-ex">If you would like to request a letter of interpretation that provides an assessment as to whether your <strong>future</strong> travels <strong>may</strong> qualify for an exemption under one of the Emergency Orders under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>, please submit your request in writing to the Public Health Agency of Canada at: <a href="mailto:phac.emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca"
    target="_blank">emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca</a>.
</p>



<p>Note that there is currently a high volume of requests, and response times are delayed. <strong>Submit your request well in advance</strong> of your travel dates, as it can take up to a month or more to receive a response. </p>

<p>The response email may be presented to the government representative at the port of entry during <strong>your next crossing</strong> to facilitate their decision as to whether an exemption applies in your case. </p>

<p> To support a thorough analysis, include the following information, at minimum:</p>
<ul>
    <li>number of travellers and country of citizenship of each traveller</li>
    <li>planned travel dates/frequency of travel</li>
    <li>specific purpose for travel to Canada</li>
    <li>an explanation as to why you believe your travel to Canada qualifies for an exemption under the Emergency Orders. Include any relevant information to support the explanation. <strong>Do not include any personal or sensitive information</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for the development of the Emergency Orders pursuant to the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>, government representatives are responsible for administering the Emergency Orders at Canada’s ports of entry. </p>
<p>As such, permission to enter Canada, or exemption from quarantine, is granted by a government representative, who is required to consider the information provided at the time of entry to determine whether a person should be permitted entry into Canada, or be exempt from quarantine. This includes reviewing travel documentation (for example, a valid passport and work permit, a letter of invitation from an employer), the quarantine plan for the arriving traveller, and any relevant exemptions.</p>
<p>A letter of interpretation from PHAC would be taken into account, but would not guarantee entry or exemption from quarantine requirements.

    COVID-19 in Canada.</p>

    <h3>Consequences for failure to comply with the Emergency Order</h3>

    <p>Failure to comply with this order is an offence under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite> and could lead to <strong>imprisonment and/or fines</strong>.</p>
