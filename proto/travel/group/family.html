            <section>

<mark>This page has gotten a bit out of sorts now. "Unite" with Citizen/PR/TR must be "immediate family" as defined, Entry to care, Funerals, etc. are for any family. Also, was looking in the feedback widget and some comments from Canadians "not finding the information for how they unite with family" So there's a need to tell Canadians yup, you can come in to be with family - just subject to quarantine and provincial restrictions (the bubble and north for example) Maybe this page needs a retitle now "Reuniting with family" (probably better for search...) and maybe the definitions of immediate family need to be included with Citizen/PR/TR since they are the only ones that apply</mark>


    <p>**New**Canadian citizens, permanent residents, persons registered under the Indian Act, and protected persons will be allowed to return to Canada by right. However, they are subject to <a href="isolation.htmll#quarantine">mandatory quarantine requirements</a> and any <a href="provinces.html">provincial or territorial restrictions</a> that could regulate family reunifications.</p>
