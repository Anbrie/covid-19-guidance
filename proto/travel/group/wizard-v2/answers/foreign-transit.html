              <p>You indicated that you are:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a foreign national</li>
                <li>not showing signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19</li>
                <li>only transiting through Canada</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Based on your answers, you will likely be allowed in Canada. The final decision is taken at the border, by a border officer.</p>

            <ul>
               <li>you must remain in the secure transit area of a Canadian airport to complete your connection</li>
               <li>you may have to follow certain <a href="../../provinces.html">provincial or territorial requirements</a>,
               depending where and how you are transiting through Canada</li>
               </ul>

               <p>Travellers transiting through Canada to Alaska for a non-discretionary purpose have additional entry conditions. </p>
                 <p>More specifically, in-transit foreign nationals:</p>
<ul>
<li>must enter Canada at one of the five identified CBSA ports of entry (POE)</li>
<ol>
<li>Abbotsford-Huntingdon (British Columbia)</li>
<li>Coutts (Alberta)</li>
<li>Kingsgate (British Columbia)</li>
<li>North Portal (Saskatchewan)</li>
<li>Osoyoos (British Columbia)</li>
</ol>
<li>will be allowed a reasonable period of stay to carry out the transit</li>
<li>will be limited to travel within Canada using the most direct route from the POE to the intended POE of exit, while avoiding all national parks, leisure sites and tourism activities</li>
<li>will be required, before entering the U.S., to report to the nearest CBSA POE to confirm their exit from Canada</li>
</ul>

<p>In-transit travellers will be issued a vehicle “hang tag” to be attached to their rear view mirror for the duration of their trip to or from Alaska to support compliance while they are in Canada. The front of the tag will make it clear that the travellers are transiting and include the date they must depart Canada. The back of the tag will remind travellers to comply with all conditions imposed upon entry and the Quarantine and Emergencies Acts and a list of public health and safety measures to follow.</p>

<p>These measures also apply to foreign nationals transiting to the U.S. through Canada from Alaska. However, entry into Canada from Alaska on the northern border is not limited to designated POEs. Additional measures might be imposed at time of entry by a border services officer (BSO).</p>

<p>Upon arrival at one of the designated POE, in-transit travellers must satisfy a BSO that they meet the requirements for entry into Canada. Travellers are encouraged to have documentation that will demonstrate their purpose of travel. The final decision is made by a BSO, based on the information available to them at time of entry.</p>

<p>Following admission into Canada, in-transit travellers are provided with a Public Health Agency of Canada handout. The document clearly states that travellers should:</p>
<li>avoid contact with others while in transit</li>
<li>remain in the vehicle as much as possible</li>
<li>not make any unnecessary stops</li>
<li>practice physical distancing at all times</li>
<li>pay at the pump if they need gas</li>
<li>use a drive through if they need food</li>
<li>wear a suitable mask or face covering while in transit</li>
<li>ensure good hygiene practices if they need to use a rest area</li>


<p>In-transit travellers are encouraged to use only those services that are open to travellers along the direct route on which they are travelling.</p>
