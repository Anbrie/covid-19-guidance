<p>Based on your answers, you must <strong>prove it is essential</strong> that you need to enter Canada for your studies and have a <a href="#">valid study permit</a>, or were approved for a study permit on or before March
18, 2020.</p>



<p>If you have compelling proof and valid study permit, you will <strong>likely be allowed</strong> to enter Canada.</p>

<h2 class="h3">Acceptable reasons to enter Canada for your studies:</h2>
<ul>
   <li>you’re already living in Canada and are returning</li>
   <li>you need to be in Canada for your program (for laboratories, workshops)</li>
   <li>your school does <strong>not</strong> have an online option</li>
   <li>your school does have an online option, but it is <strong>not</strong> possible from your home country (due to
      internet restrictions, bandwidth limitation, or timezone differences where you would be awake at unreasonable
      hours)</li>
</ul>


         <h2 class="h3">What you need to do next</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="../../isolation.html#quarantine">read and follow the mandatory quarantine requirements</a></li>
<li>make sure you have a suitable place and plan to quarantine</li>            <li><a href="../../provinces.html">read the provincial or territorial requirements</a> </li>
         </ul>

         
   <details><summary>Students travelling with immediate family</summary>

      <p>If you are travelling with immediate family, such as your spouse or a dependent child, they <strong>may be allowed</strong> to enter Canada with you. They will need to meet the same requirements and proof for entry as a <a href="../../family.html">foreign nationals reuniting with immediate family</a></p>.</p>

            <summary>Students in a health field: quarantine exemptions</summary>
         
            <p>If you are working in Canada as a student in a health field, you will likely be exempt from quarantine as long as you do not
               directly care for persons 65 years of age or older within the 14-day period that begins on the day
               you enter Canada.</p><p>You must still comply with any additional provincial or territorial requirements.</p>
         
         </details>
         
<h2 class="h3">This answer does not guarantee entry into Canada</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Final determination regarding entry is made by a government representative at the port of entry based on the
      information presented to them at the time of entry into Canada.</li>
   <li>You must meet the entry requirements under the <cite><a
            href="https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/">Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</a></cite> and
      provide appropriate travel and immigration documentation.</li>
   <li>Failure to <a href="../../isolation.html#complying">comply with the COVID-19 Emergency order</a> is an offence
      under the <em>Quarantine Act</em> and could lead to imprisonment and/or fines.</li>
