               <p>General guidance:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>don't put caveats in wizard choices, they will limit choices for someone planning or trying to understand entry conditions</li>
                  <li>provide clear examples that have tangible meaning (for example: "funerals" and "sitting vigil")</li>
                  <li>word things simple for people to understand and get moving on the right path, and then introduce OIC language as needed</li>
                  <li>use choices to help people understand complex definitions (immediate family)</li>
                  <li>80% rule. Make sure the wizard handles the primary reasons for entry really well, so the phone lines are free for those who have to call for more complex things</li>
                  <li>avoid definitions or footnotes in wizard questions unless there is no other way, the questions and choices should eliminate the need whenever possible</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>When to create an additional choice in existing question options</h2>

               <p>Choices can share the same answer as another choice, but only if the are an exact match in information. This is used when choices are different things in order to help people make the choice they need to, but they loop back to being exactly the same answer (such as the "reasons for entry that require quarantine" for citizens, and the "no entry permitted" answers for foreign citizens).</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Yes: The current choices don't show an obvious path forward
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: (in discussion right now) organ donors have no obvious path. It's likely they would choose "receiving medical treatment" choice in Q3b, Q4b (can they come in from non-U.S. ?) Does this answer accurately inform them? Does the caveat of the XH period apply to them? If not, they need their own radio and answer.</li>
                        
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Yes: They're related in the OIC, but people think of them as different entry reasons. Be specific for each and have specific information for each answer.
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: **shared with PHAC/EO team already**</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: A current choice can be modified slightly to catch the new choice
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: Add "marine-research" to fishing choice. The answer for marine research follows the same
                           rules as research fishing-related activities. Any specific caveat for marine research
                           could be an expand-collapse in the answer.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: It's simple and reasonable to combine the choices
                     <ul>
                     <li>For example: "national interest" and "invited to assist with COVID-19" are one choice since the answers are an exact match of information (it's a simple page with minimal text) and not a likely audience for the wizard.</li>

                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <h2>When to create a new answer page</h2>


               <ul>
                  <li>Yes: Answers should be specific, especially for top tasks. If a choice has information that is different for the caveat about entry or the steps to follow, it needs a seperate answer.</li>
                  <li>No: An answer page exists already that matches entry conditions 1 to 1.
                     <ul><li>For example: "non-U.S. medical treatment" has been corrected to be a "not travel exempt reason". Many calls have been documented concerning medical entry, so this choice radio choice should remain here so they can find out they can't enter. However, the answer and the explanation is the same as any other "optional reason" and the choices can share the same answer.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>No: An exisiting answer page just needs a small modification
                     <ul>For example: Cross-border students do not need their own answer page. There is an expand-collapse on the trans-border community answer and in the U.S. students answer. They will relate to one of those choices and find the correct information.</ul>
                  </li>
                  </li>
               </ul>


               <h2>When to create an additional question for logic</h2>
               
               <ul>
                  <li>Yes: If a simple follow-up yes, no or multiple choice question simplifies the answer page by reducing the number of caveats for entry.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example: (totally imagined fake scenario) 
                           <br>If non-U.S. entry wildlife biologists could enter Canada, but only if they are here for 5 particular Canadian species, they have to fly in on a Monday, and there's a list of approved equipment they must be using. In this imagined scenario, there are a lot of caveats.
                           <br><strong>Wizard choice work (Q4c)</strong>: wildlife biologist (this choice has no caveats, we let the follow up question and answers handle the needed clarity)
                           <br><strong>Follow up question</strong>: Are you studying one of the following species? Answers: the 5 valid species by scientific name (This follow up will eliminate complexity on the answer page, and it's the right question to ask to remove people not studying animals for which entry to study is permitted. If they choose a species they can enter to study (and the whole goal of their entry) they can likely adjust their plans to meet entry conditions. If not, they will be denied entry and get a clear answer as to why. Someone who is told they cannot enter might be able to make modifications to their plans in order to meet Canada's entry requirements, but the idea is to lead someone to find all the information and make informed choices.)
                           <br><strong>Intro text caveat (1b)</strong>: You will likely be allowed to enter Canada, but you must enter by plane on a Monday and use only the approved equipment.
                           <br><strong>Entry caveat explained (1c)</strong>: Bullet list of the approved equipment you must be using
                           <br><strong>Next steps (2)</strong>: Plan your flight to Canada to arrive on a Monday. Bring all the approved equipment.
                        </li>
                     </ul>

                  </li>
                  <li>Yes: If a simple follow-up to a choice creates a new answer for a specific group who have specific steps to take (and denies the other group entry)
                     <ul><li>For example: Ask a foreigners with symptoms if they are seeking refugee status (this could also be an expand-collapse caveat in the "foreign-symptoms" option, however, it is much better to craft an answer with the steps for entry)</li></ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: If the answer has an entry caveat, but it requires a written explanation to understand and cannot be a simple yes, no, or multiple choice answer.
                     <ul>For example: Students cannot be expected to answer a question if their entry is necessary (not optional) without knowing what that means. Let them read it in the answer and see what they must do or prove as part of the entry process.</ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: Don't use it to clarify a choice already made
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: If someone chooses they are a temporary foreign worker, don't ask if they have applied for a permit as a follow up question. While of course the permit is relevant to entry, they already made the choice of currently being a TFW. The answer reminds them to be aware their documents must be in order.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: Don't create unnecessary complexity
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: Don't ask a Technican or Specialist which sector they work in, and create 10 different answers for each sector and 1 answer (none of the above) to deny them entry.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  
               
               </ul>
