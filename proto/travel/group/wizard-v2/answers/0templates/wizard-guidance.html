               <ul>
                  <li>don't put caveats in wizard choices which will limit choices for someone planning or understanding entry conditions</li>
                  <li>provide clear examples that have tangible meaning (for example: "funerals" and "sitting vigil")</li>
                  <li>keep wording simple to get people moving on the right path, and then introduce OIC language as needed when they get there</li>
                  <li>use choices to help people understand complex definitions (immediate family)</li>
                  <li>80% rule. Make sure the wizard handles the primary reasons for entry really well, so the phone lines are free for those who have to call for more complex things</li>
                  <li>avoid definitions or footnotes in wizard questions unless there is no other way, the questions and choices should eliminate the need whenever possible</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Designing answers:</h2>
               <ul>
                  <li><a href="citizen-template.html">citizen without symptoms template</a></li>
                  <li><a href="foreign-template.html">foreign national without symptoms template</a></li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Using alerts when an OIC changes:</h2>
               <ol>
                  <li>Add a generic alert when a new OIC is in effect on the affected answer pages only. Expect call volume to be temporarily higher. A generic alert should not be up for longer than <strong>5 business days</strong>.</li>
                 <li>Update to a specific alert once web content and instructions become available. Reduce calls and email volume again, because it is now possible to find online. This step can be skipped if wizard answer can be updated within 5 days. If you update a generic alert to become a specific alert, it can remain for an additional <strong>5 business days</strong> while the answer is designed.</li>
                 <li>Remove alert once answer has been properly incorporated into the wizard</li>
               </ol>

               <p>How to use alerts:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><a href="../alert-demos/foreign-US-trans-border-generic.html">generic change alert</a> (most of the answer still applies, so the answer instructions remain on the page. If the answer instructions have completely changed, they should be removed)</li>
                  <li><a href="../alert-demos/foreign-transit-land-press-release.html">specific change alert</a> (entry is possible, and there is updated web content with instructions that can be linked to. There are no detailed answer instructions on the page in order not to confuse people with old content)</li>
                  <li><a href="../alert-demos/foreign-non-US-not-travel-exempt-no-wizard-choice.html">wizard logic change</a> (if a new group(s) of traveller(s) is permitted to enter, use an alert on the "none of the above" or "no entry" type answers to inform travellers. Instruct them to call (or link to web content with instructions) if they fall into the new group(s) to find out what to do)</li>
               </ul>

               <p>Don't use alerts:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>to put warnings in the questions (logic flow)</li>
                     <li>as a replacement for easily updated answer (such a case of entry being no longer permitted for a group, or simple update to entry criteria like a single bullet point, or sentence of content to update)</li>
                     <li>to put an info message about what was updated in the answer</li>
                  </ul>

               <h2>When to create an additional choice in existing question options</h2>

               <p>Choices can share the same answer as another choice, but only if the are an exact match in information. This is used when choices are different things in order to help people make the choice they need to, but they loop back to being exactly the same answer (such as the "reasons for entry that require quarantine" for citizens, and the "no entry permitted" answers for foreign citizens).</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Yes: The current choices don't show an obvious path forward
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: (in discussion right now) organ donors have no obvious path. It's likely they would choose "receiving medical treatment" choice in Q3b, Q4b (can they come in from non-U.S. ?) Does this answer accurately inform them? Does the caveat of the XH period apply to them? If not, they need their own radio and answer.</li>
                        
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Yes: They're related in the OIC, but people think of them as different entry reasons. Be specific for each and have specific information for each answer.
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: **shared with PHAC/EO team already**</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: A current choice can be modified slightly to catch the new choice
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: Add "marine-research" to fishing choice. The answer for marine research follows the same
                           rules as research fishing-related activities. Any specific caveat for marine research
                           could be an expand-collapse in the answer.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: It's simple and reasonable to combine the choices
                     <ul>
                     <li>For example: "national interest" and "invited to assist with COVID-19" are one choice since the answers are an exact match of information (it's a simple page with minimal text) and not a likely audience for the wizard.</li>

                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <h2>When to create a new answer page</h2>


               <ul>
                  <li>Yes: Answers should be specific, especially for top tasks. If a choice has information that is different for the caveat about entry or the steps to follow, it needs a seperate answer.</li>
                  <li>No: An answer page exists already that matches entry conditions 1 to 1.
                     <ul><li>For example: "non-U.S. medical treatment" has been corrected to be a "not travel exempt reason". Many calls have been documented concerning medical entry, so this choice radio choice should remain here so they can find out they can't enter. However, the answer and the explanation is the same as any other "optional reason" and the choices can share the same answer.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>No: An exisiting answer page just needs a small modification
                     <ul>For example: Cross-border students do not need their own answer page. There is an expand-collapse on the trans-border community answer and in the U.S. students answer. They will relate to one of those choices and find the correct information.</ul>
                  </li>
                  </li>
               </ul>


               <h2>When to create an additional question for logic</h2>
               <p>Questions should guide someone in a simple and direct manner to their answer. Ask only as many as are needed.</p>

               <ul>
                  <li>Yes: An additional question would remove complexity from an answer page that would otherwise have a large number of caveats and instructions (and can be answered by a simple follow-up yes, no or multiple choice question).
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example: (totally imagined fake scenario) 
                           <br>If non-U.S. entry wildlife biologists could enter Canada, but only if they are researching 5 particular Canadian species, they have to fly in on a Monday, and there's a list of approved equipment they must be using. In this imagined scenario, there are a lot of caveats.
                           <br><strong>Wizard choice work (Q4c)</strong>:<br>
                           • wildlife biologist (this choice has no caveats, we let the follow up question and answers handle the needed clarity)
                           <br><strong>Follow up question</strong>:
                           <br>Which of the following species is your primary subject of study? (Of these caveats, this one is appropriate as a question to ask because it specifically concerns a reason for entry that is not likely something that can be changed by the traveller. Other examples: citizenship status, family status)
                           <br><strong>Answer choices</strong>:<br>
                            The 5 valid species by scientific name, and "none of the above" (If they choose a species they are permitted entry to study, they can likely adjust their travel plans to meet the entry conditions of <strong>flying in on Sunday</strong> and <strong>use approved equipment</strong>. If not, they will be denied entry and get a clear answer as to why.)
                           <br><strong>Intro text caveat (1b)</strong>:
                           <br>You will likely be allowed to enter Canada, but you must enter by plane on a Monday and use only the approved equipment.
                           <br><strong>Entry caveat explained (1c)</strong>: 
                           <br>Bullet list of the approved equipment you must be using
                           <br><strong>Next steps (2)</strong>:
                           <br>Plan your flight to Canada so that you will arrive on a Monday. <br>Bring only approved equipment.
                        </li>
                     </ul>

                  </li>
                  
                  <li>Yes: There is a new answer for a specific group who have specific steps of their own to take (and can be answered by a simple follow-up yes, no or multiple choice question)
                     <ul><li>For example: Ask a foreigners with symptoms if they are seeking refugee status (this could also be an expand-collapse caveat in the "foreign-symptoms" option, however, it is much better to craft an answer with the steps for entry)</li></ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Caution: Asking a follow up question for something very simple that already fits into the answer introduction (1 or 1.b) and "What you need to do next" (2).
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: non-U.S. students could of had a follow up question asking when their permit was approved. We decided not to because it's very simple as introductory text, and a "What to do next step". If we asked someone that question prior to the answer, it becomes repetitive to repeat it in the answer page, so then the date of the permit should become part of the "You indicated" only section. This is where monitoring of the wizard feedback comes into play and listening to what CBSA is experiencing at the border, and running your own tests. Fix what you hear isn't working or not clear enough, and leave what works well alone.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: If the answer has an entry caveat, but it requires a written explanation to understand and cannot be a simple yes, no, or multiple choice answer.
                     <ul>For example: Students cannot be expected to answer a question if their entry is necessary (not optional) without knowing what that means. Let them read it in the answer and see what they must do or prove as part of the entry process.</ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: Don't use it to clarify a choice already made
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: If someone chooses they are a temporary foreign worker, don't ask if they have applied for a permit as a follow up question. While of course the permit is relevant to entry, they already made the choice of currently being a TFW. The answer reminds them to be aware their documents must be in order.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>No: Don't create unnecessary complexity
                     <ul>
                        <li>For example: Don't ask a Technican or Specialist which sector they work in, and create 10 different answer pages for each sector and 1 answer page (none of the above) to deny them entry and then explain why by repeating the 10 sectors they didn't qualify under.</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
                  
               
               </ul>
