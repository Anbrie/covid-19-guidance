                  information to a border services officer when seeking entry. This information is collected on behalf of the Public
                  Health Agency of Canada to support their compliance and enforcement of the <a href="/isolation.html">14-day
                     quarantine or isolation

                  <h3>Screening</h3>
                  <p>We assess all travellers, no matter their country of origin, upon arrival to Canada. Entry screening is one of
                     many
                     important public health tools and part of a multilayered government response strategy.</p>
                  <p>A border services officer will ask you when you arrive in Canada at an air, land, marine or rail border about the
                     purpose of your visit and whether you are feeling ill or unwell. The border services officer may ask additional
                     questions as part of their assessment.</p>
                  <p><abbr>CBSA</abbr> officers will look for signs of illness, regardless of how you respond to screening questions.
                     Officers will refer any traveller they suspect is ill for a further medical assessment by the Public Health Agency
                     of
                     Canada.</p>

               <p>As of July 21, 2020, the restriction on all optional and non-essential (discretionary) travel at the Canada-U.S. border that was initially
               implemented on March 21, 2020, was extended until August 21, 2020.</p>

               <p>If you do not have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and must cross the border for work or other non-discretionary
               purposes, you may continue to do so. Even if you are permitted to cross the border, <a href="./isolation.html#quarantine">mandatory quarantine</a> measures may still apply upon your return to Canada.</p>


                     <h3 id="waters">Entering Canadian waters</h3>
                     <p>You currently cannot enter Canadian waters for non-essential reasons, such as:</p>

                        fishing-related activites, you may be allowed to enter Canadian waters.</p>
