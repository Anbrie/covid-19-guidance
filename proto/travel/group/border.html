   <p>First, you should determine whether or not you can come to Canada.</p>
   <p><a href="./travel-restrictions-expand-collapse-2.html">Who can come to Canada</a></p>

<p>As of March 31, 2020, anyone arriving in Canada by any mode (air, land or marine) must provide their contact
   information to a Border Services Officer when seeking entry. Border services collects this information on behalf of the Public
   Health Agency of Canada to help enforce compliance with the 14-day quarantine or isolation requirement.</p>
               <p><a href="/isolation.html">Mandatory isolation and quarantine</a></p>


   <p>You <strong>must</strong> wear a <span class="nowrap">non-medical</span> mask or face covering upon arrival in
      Canada.</p>
   
   
   <p>We encourage you to download our mobile app prior to arrival to reduce wait times and limit contact at the border:</p>

      <summary>How we screen travellers</summary>
   
      <h3>Screening</h3>
      <p>We assess all travellers, no matter their country of origin, upon arrival to Canada. Entry screening is one of
         many
         important public health tools. It is part of a multi-layered government response strategy.</p>
      <p>When you arrive in Canada at an air, land, marine or rail border, a Border Services Officer will ask you:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>what the purpose of your visit is</li>
         <li>whether you are feeling ill or unwell</li>
         <li>other questions as needed to complete their assessment</li>
      </ul>
      <p><abbr>CBSA</abbr> officers will look for signs of illness, regardless of how you respond to screening questions.
         Officers will refer any traveller they suspect is ill for a further medical assessment by the Public Health Agency
         of
         Canada.</p>

<h2 id="border">Canada-U.S. border</h2>
               <p>The Canada-U.S. temporary border restriction implemented on March 21, 2020 continues. <strong>All discretionary (optional) travel remains prohibited</strong>.</p>

                  <p>You may travel through Canada to Alaska for non-discretionary (non-optional) reasons, but there are special entry conditions. These measures also apply when transiting from Alaska to the lower 48 states. However, entry into Canada from Alaska on the northern border is not limited to a specific port of entry.</p>

<li>Kingsgate (British Columbia)</li>

<p> Upon arrival at one of the designated POE, you must satisfy a Border Services Officer (BSO) that you meet the requirements for entry into Canada.
