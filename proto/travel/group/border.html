   <p>First, you should determine whether or not you can come to Canada.</p>
   <p><a href="./travel-restrictions-expand-collapse-2.html">Who can come to Canada</a></p>

<p>As of March 31, 2020, anyone arriving in Canada by any mode (air, land or marine) must provide their contact
   information to a border services officer when seeking entry. This information is collected on behalf of the Public
   Health Agency of Canada to support their compliance and enforcement of the <a href="/isolation.html">14-day
      quarantine or isolation
      requirement.</a>

</p>


   <p>You <strong>must</strong> wear <span class="nowrap">non-medical</span> masks or face covering upon arrival in
      Canada. Masks or face coverings may be provided upon arrival as appropriate.</p>
   
   
   <p>Travellers are encouraged to download the mobile <a

      <summary>How we screen travellers</summary>
   
      <h3>Screening</h3>
      <p>We assess all travellers, no matter their country of origin, upon arrival to Canada. Entry screening is one of
         many
         important public health tools and part of a multilayered government response strategy.</p>
      <p>A border services officer will ask you when you arrive in Canada at an air, land, marine or rail border about the
         purpose of your visit and whether you are feeling ill or unwell. The border services officer may ask additional
         questions as part of their assessment.</p>
      <p><abbr>CBSA</abbr> officers will look for signs of illness, regardless of how you respond to screening questions.
         Officers will refer any traveller they suspect is ill for a further medical assessment by the Public Health Agency
         of
         Canada.</p>
   </details>
<h2 id="border">Canada-U.S. border</h2>
               <p>As of July 21, 2020, the restriction on all optional and non-essential (discretionary) travel at the Canada-U.S. border that was initially
               implemented on March 21, 2020, was extended until August 21, 2020.</p>








                  <h2 id="alaska">Transit between Alaska and the contiguous United States</h2>

                  <p>You may still travel through Canada Alaska for non-discretionary (essential) reasons, but you will have additional entry conditions. These measures also apply to foreign nationals transiting through to the U.S. through Canada from Alaska. However, entry into Canada from Alaska on the northern border is not limited to
designated POEs.</p>

<mark>ALL Norther border POEs are open</mark>

<p> Upon arrival at one of the designated POE, you must satisfy a BSO that you meet the requirements for entry into Canada.
