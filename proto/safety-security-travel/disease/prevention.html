		<h2 id="h">How coronavirus spreads</h2>
		<p>Human coronaviruses cause infections of the nose, throat and lungs. They are most commonly spread from an infected
			person through:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>respiratory droplets generated when you cough or sneeze</li>
			<li>close, prolonged personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands</li>
			<li>touching something with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Current evidence suggests person-to-person spread is efficient when there is close contact.</p>
		<h2 id="self">Difference between quarantine (self-isolate) and isolate</h2>
		<p>There is a difference between advice to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-home-exposed-no-symptoms.html">quarantine</a>
			(self-isolate) and advice to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html">isolate</a>.
			These measures are in place to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</p>
		<p><a
				href="../../safety-security-travel/travel/restrictions.html">Additional
				restrictions apply to travellers returning to Canada</a>.</p>
		<h3>Quarantine (self-isolate)</h3>
		<p>Quarantine for 14 days if you have <strong>no symptoms</strong> and <strong>any</strong> of the following apply:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>you are returning from travel&nbsp;<strong>outside of Canada</strong> (mandatory quarantine)</li>
			<li>you had close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19</li>
			<li>you have been told by the public health authority that you may have been exposed and need to quarantine</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="si">Isolate</h3>
		<p>You must isolate if <strong>any</strong> of the following apply:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, or are waiting to hear the results of a lab test for COVID-19</li>
			<li>you have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild</li>
			<li>you have been in contact with a suspected, probable or confirmed case of COVID-19</li>
			<li>you have been told by public health that you may have been exposed to COVID-19</li>
			<li>you have returned from travel outside Canada with symptoms of COVID-19 (mandatory)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="p">Preventing coronavirus</h2>
		<p>Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread
			of COVID-19 in Canada. This includes staying at home as much as possible and <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/being-prepared.html#a2">being
				prepared</a> in case you or a family member becomes ill. Everyone should be practising physical (social) distancing.
			Even if you do not have symptoms of COVID-19, you could become infected by others.</p>
		<p>As we continue to see transmission of the virus within different communities, we know that everyone must take
			precautions, even those who have not travelled outside of Canada.</p>
		<p>In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within communities and across the country, all Canadians are advised
			to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>stay at home unless you have to go to work
				<ul>
					<li>talk to your employer about working at home if possible</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>avoid all non-essential trips in your community</li>
			<li>do not gather in groups</li>
			<li>limit contact with people at higher risk, such as older adults and those in poor health</li>
			<li>go outside to exercise but stay close to home</li>
			<li>if you leave your home, always keep a distance of at least 2 arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others
				<ul>
					<li>household contacts (people you live with) do not need to distance from each other unless they are sick or have
						travelled in the last 14 days</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>You can go for a walk if you:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>have not been diagnosed with COVID-19</li>
			<li>do not have symptoms of COVID-19</li>
			<li>have not travelled outside of Canada in the past 14 days</li>
			<li>are not in quarantine (self-isolating)</li>
			<li>are not isolating</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you go out for a walk, do not congregate and always practise physical (social) distancing by keeping at least 2
			metres apart from others at all times.</p>
		<p>Think you might have COVID-19?<br>
			<a href="https://ca.thrive.health/covid19/en" class="btn btn-success" rel="external">Take a self-assessment</a></p>
		<h3 id="social">Physical (social) distancing</h3>
		<p>Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each
			other. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">Physical (social)
				distancing</a> is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak.
		</p>
		<p>This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings</li>
			<li>avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes</li>
			<li>limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health</li>
			<li>keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h3>
		<p>Proper hygiene can help reduce the risk of infection or spreading infection to others:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the washroom and when
				preparing food
				<ul>
					<li>use alcohol-based <a
							href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html">hand
							sanitizer</a> if soap and water are not available</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>when coughing or sneezing:
				<ul>
					<li>cough or sneeze into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand</li>
					<li>dispose of any tissues you have used as soon as possible in a lined waste basket and wash your hands
						afterwards</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Cleaning</h3>
		<p>Coronaviruses&nbsp;are one of the easiest types of viruses to kill with the appropriate disinfectant product when
			used according to the label directions. Health Canada has published a&nbsp;<a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/list.html">list of hard surface
				disinfectants</a>&nbsp;that are likely to be effective for use against COVID-19.</p>
		<p>Although they do not claim to kill COVID-19, cleaners can play a role in limiting the transfer of microorganisms.
			Health Canada recommends cleaning high-touch surfaces often, using either regular household cleaners or diluted
			bleach. This bleach solution should be prepared according to the instructions on the label or in a ratio of 1 teaspoon
			(5 mL) per cup (250 mL). Directions are based on bleach that is 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium
			hypochlorite solution.</p>
		<p>These surfaces include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>toys</li>
			<li>toilets</li>
			<li>phones</li>
			<li>electronics</li>
			<li>door handles</li>
			<li>bedside tables</li>
			<li>television remotes</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Refer to the <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/cleaning-disinfecting-public-spaces.html">guidance
				on cleaning and disinfecting public spaces</a> for more information.</p>
		<h3 id="wm">Wearing masks or face coverings</h3>
		<p>Medical masks, including surgical, medical procedure face masks and respirators (like N95 masks), must be kept for
			health care workers and others providing direct care to COVID-19 patients.</p>
		<p>Wearing a non-medical mask or face covering while out in public is optional. If you do choose to wear one, refer to
			our <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/instructions-sew-no-sew-cloth-face-covering.html">guidelines
				on wearing non-medical masks and how to make your own</a>. </p>
		<p>Masks alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19. You must consistently and strictly adhere to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene">good
				hygiene</a> and <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p">public health
				measures</a>, including frequent <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html">hand
				washing</a> and <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">physical (social)
				distancing</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="r">Risks of getting coronavirus</h2>
		<p>COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily. The risk will vary between and within
			communities, but given the increasing number of cases in Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered
			<strong>high</strong>.</p>
		<p>This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on
			our health care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could impact
			health care resources available to Canadians.</p>
		<p>The risk for COVID-19 may be increased for certain settings such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#cruise">cruise
					ships</a></li>
			<li>crowded areas (such as public transit and shopping centres)</li>
			<li>gatherings (spiritual and cultural settings, theatres, sports arenas, festivals and conferences)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Check if you have been exposed</h3>
		<p>Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice/exposure-flights-cruise-ships-mass-gatherings.html">exposure
				locations</a> to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.</p>
		<h3>Vulnerable populations</h3>
		<p>There is an increased risk of more severe outcomes for Canadians:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>aged 65 and over</li>
			<li>with compromised immune systems</li>
			<li>with underlying medical conditions</li>
		</ul>
		<p>People that fall into these categories should reconsider attending gatherings. This includes large gatherings and
			even smaller events in crowded or enclosed settings.</p>
		<p>If you have symptoms (cough, fever or difficulty breathing), do not attend a mass gathering, event or places where
			people gather. You could put someone whose health is vulnerable at risk.</p>
		<h3 id="travellers">Travellers</h3>
		<p>The risk for getting COVID-19 may be increased for travellers. Canadians are advised to <a
				href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/221">avoid all non-essential travel</a>.
			If you must travel, check the latest <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html">travel
				advice</a> before you leave.</p>
		<p>We will continue to adapt our risk assessment based on the latest data available.</p>
		<h3 id="pregnant">Pregnant women</h3>
		<p>Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there
			is&nbsp;<strong>no evidence</strong> to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes
			related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19.</p>
		<p>You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>stay home&nbsp;as much as possible, except for important medical appointments</li>
			<li>talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife&nbsp;about the possibility of telephone or videoconference
				appointments</li>
			<li>avoid unnecessary visitors&nbsp;to your home</li>
			<li><a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html">wash
					your hands</a>&nbsp;often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
				<ul>
					<li>use alcohol-based&nbsp;<a
							href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html">hand
							sanitizer</a>&nbsp;if soap and water are not available</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>practise&nbsp;<a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">physical
					distancing</a>&nbsp;by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others</li>
			<li>avoid touching&nbsp;your mouth, nose and eyes</li>
			<li>avoid crowded places and peak-hours</li>
			<li>make limited trips to the store for essentials</li>
			<li>avoid travel by public transit</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For more information, refer to our&nbsp;<a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/pregnancy-advise-mothers.html">advice for mothers
				on pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns</a>.</p>
		<p>If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.</p>
		<h3 id="products">Survival of coronaviruses on surfaces</h3>
		It is not certain how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Preliminary
		information on COVID-19 suggests that the virus may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days depending
		on different conditions, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>temperature</li>
			<li>type of surface</li>
			<li>humidity of the environment</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Surfaces frequently touched with hands are most likely to be contaminated, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>tables</li>
			<li>handrails</li>
			<li>doorknobs</li>
			<li>electronics</li>
			<li>countertops</li>
			<li>light switches</li>
			<li>faucet handles</li>
			<li>cabinet handles</li>
			<li>elevator buttons</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Products shipped within or from outside of Canada could also be contaminated. However, because parcels generally take
			days or weeks to be delivered, and are shipped at room temperature, the risk of spread is <strong>low</strong>. There
			is no known risk of coronaviruses entering Canada on parcels or packages.</p>
		<p>To protect yourself from COVID-19, make sure to do the following when handling products shipped within or outside of
			Canada:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>use good <a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene">hygiene
					measures</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19.html">regularly clean and
					disinfect surfaces</a></li>
			<li>do not touch your eyes, nose and mouth</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
		<p>There is currently no evidence to suggest that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus and
			there are currently no reported cases of COVID 19 transmission through food. People are unlikely to be infected with
			the virus through food.</p>
		<p>Scientists and food safety authorities across the world are closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19.</p>
		<p>If we become aware of a potential food safety risk, appropriate actions will be taken to ensure the safety of
			Canada's food supply.</p>
		<p>Coronaviruses are killed by <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/general-food-safety-tips/food-safety-you.html#a2">common cleaning and disinfection
				methods</a> and by cooking food to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/general-food-safety-tips/safe-internal-cooking-temperatures.html">safe internal
				temperatures</a>.</p>
		<p>Learn more about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/general-food-safety-tips/food-safety-you.html#a2">food
				safety</a>.</p>
		<h3 id="animal-canada">Animals in Canada</h3>
		<p>The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human-to-human transmission. There is no evidence to suggest that pets
			or other animals play a role in transmitting the disease to humans. Scientists are still trying to understand if and
			how it affects animals.</p>
		<p>Pets can contribute to our overall happiness and well-being, especially in times of stress. If you are feeling well
			(no symptoms of COVID-19) and are not self-isolating because of COVID-19 illness, you can continue to take walks with
			your dog or spend time with your pet. This can contribute to keeping both you and your pet healthy.</p>
		<p>As a precautionary measure, if you have COVID-19 <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms.html#s">symptoms</a> or are <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-home-exposed-no-symptoms.html">self-isolating</a>
			due to contact with a COVID-19 case, you should follow similar recommendations around animals, as you would around
			people in these circumstances:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>avoid close contact with animals during your illness
				<ul>
					<li>practise good handwashing and avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals</li>
					<li>do not visit farms or have contact with livestock</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>if possible, have another member of your household care for your animals
				<ul>
					<li>if this is not possible, always wash your hands before and after touching animals, their food and supplies and
						practise good cough and sneezing etiquette</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>limit your animal's contact with other people and animals outside the household until your illness is resolved
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These measures are recommended as a precaution, and are basic practices to prevent transmission of diseases between
			humans and animals. If you have concerns, seek professional advice from your veterinarian or a public health
			professional who can help to answer your questions.</p>
