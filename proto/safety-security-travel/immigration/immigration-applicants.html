<p><strong>Temporary foreign workers, some international students and approved permanent residents who haven’t yet landed are now able to enter Canada.</strong></p>
<p>The travel restriction exemptions that were announced are now in place. If you’re exempt, you can now travel to Canada.</p>
<p>If you’re travelling by air, you need to pass a health check conducted by airlines before you’re allowed to board your flight. Anyone who shows symptoms of COVID-19 will not be allowed to enter Canada by air. </p>
<p>When you arrive in Canada we’ll assess your health before you leave the port of entry. <strong>You must <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html">isolate</a> for 14 days even if you have no symptoms. This is mandatory.</strong> </p>
<p>Only people who provide essential services and truck drivers who regularly cross the border to maintain the flow of goods are exempt from the isolation requirements.</p>
