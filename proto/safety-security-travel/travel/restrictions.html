<h2 id="f">Travellers returning to Canada</h2>
<p>The Government of Canada has put in place an <a href="https://orders-in-council.canada.ca/attachment.php?attach=38989&amp;lang=en">emergency order</a> under the&nbsp;<em>Quarantine Act</em>. It applies to all travellers  arriving in Canada. Its purpose is to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Canada.  Failure to&nbsp;comply&nbsp;with this order is an offence under the&nbsp;<em>Quarantine  Act</em>.</p>

<h3 id="f1">With or without symptoms: mandatory isolation</h3>

<ul class="list-unstyled">
 <li>
  <details>
   <summary>Traveller with symptoms</summary>
	 <p>If you are Canadian or a permanent resident, and you have symptoms  consistent with COVID-19, <strong>you may still  enter Canada by land, rail or sea</strong>.&nbsp;You may <strong>not</strong> enter Canada by air, to protect the health of all  travellers.</p>

	 <p>If you need it, we will provide you with immediate medical attention when you arrive in Canada.</p>





	 <p><strong>If&nbsp;you have symptoms, you must&nbsp;</strong><a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/travellers-with-symptoms-return-canada.html"><strong>isolate</strong></a> for 14 days<strong>. This is mandatory.</strong></p>


	 <ul>
	 <li>You  must isolate in a place where you will not have contact with vulnerable people,  such as:
	 <ul>
	 	<li>people 65 years or older, or </li>
	 	<li>people with underlying medical  conditions. </li>
	 </ul></li>
	 <li>You  will need to confirm you have a suitable place to isolate where you will have  access to the basic necessities such as food and medication.</li>
	 <li>You must  use private transportation (such as your own vehicle) to get to your place of  isolation<strong></strong></li>
	 <li>You  must wear a non-medical mask or face covering while traveling to your place of  isolation<strong></strong></li>
	 </ul>

	 <p>If you do not have  private transportation or an adequate place to isolate, the Chief Public Health  Officer of Canada will designate a facility where you must isolate for 14 days. </p>






	 <p><strong>In addition to the above, mandatory isolation means you must:</strong>


	 </p><div class="row">
	 <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8">



	 	<ul>
	 		<li>go directly to your place of isolation  without stopping anywhere </li>

	 		<ul>
	 		<li>do not go to school, work or any other public areas</li>
	 		</ul></li>
	 		<li>stay in a separate room and  use a separate bathroom from others, if possible</li>

	 		<li>contact your health care  provider or public health authority immediately if your symptoms get worse, and  follow their instructions</li>
	 	</ul>

	 <p>If you have symptoms but do not have a place to isolate, you will be  required to isolate for 14 days in a facility designated by the Chief Public  Health Officer of Canada.</p>

	 <ul>
	 <li>You must quarantine (self-isolate) in a place where you will have no contact with vulnerable people, such as:

<h3 id="Check_if_you">Check if you have been exposed</h3>
<p>Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public  gathering? Check the listed <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice/exposure-flights-cruise-ships-mass-gatherings.html">exposure locations</a> to see if you may have been  exposed to COVID-19.</p>
<h3 id="a2">Compliance and enforcement of the <em>Quarantine Act</em></h3>

<p>The Government of Canada is working with federal and provincial partners  to promote and verify compliance of the emergency order with active communication and spot checks.</p>


<p>If you are permitted to enter Canada, you will be:</p>


<ul>
<li>asked if you have a cough, fever or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>required to acknowledge that you must:
<ul>
	<li>&nbsp;isolate for 14 days if you have symptoms of&nbsp; COVID-19 or </li>
	<li>&nbsp;quarantine (self-isolate) for 14 days if you do not have symptoms</li>
</ul></li>
<li>asked if you have a suitable place to isolate or quarantine (self-isolate)
<ul>
	<li>a suitable place is one where you will have basic necessities such as food and medication, and where you will not have contact with vulnerable people</li>
</ul></li>
<li>given instructions about your obligations under the emergency order</li>
</ul>



<p>Violating any instructions provided to you when you entered Canada is an  offence under the <em>Quarantine Act</em> and could lead to up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 months in prison&nbsp;<strong>and/or</strong></li>
<li>$750,000 in fines</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, a person who causes a risk of imminent death or serious bodily  harm to another person while wilfully or recklessly contravening this act or  the regulations could be liable for:</p>

<ul>
<li>a fine of up to $1,000,000&nbsp;<strong>or</strong></li>
<li>imprisonment of up to 3 years&nbsp;<strong>or</strong></li>
<li>both</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a3">Exemptions to travel restrictions</h3>

<p>The continued global movement of goods and people and the ongoing  delivery of essential services will be important for Canada's response to  COVID-19.</p>

<p>Several categories of people are <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-information-essential-service-workers.html">exempted</a> from this order because they  provide critical services, if they have&nbsp;<strong>no symptoms</strong>. These include  people who:</p>

<ul>
<li>are  making necessary medical deliveries required for patient care, such as:
	<ul>
		<li>cells</li>
		<li>organs</li>
		<li>tissues</li>
		<li>blood and blood products</li>
		<li>other similar lifesaving human body  parts </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>work in the trade and transportation sector who are important for the movement of goods and people, including:
	<ul>
		<li>truck drivers</li>
		<li>crew on any plane, train or marine  vessel </li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>cross the border regularly to go to work, including in the health care sector or critical infrastructure workers </li>
<li>have to cross the border to provide or receive essential services, including emergency responders and personnel providing essential services to Canadians related to the COVID-19 outbreak</li>
</ul>

<p>Workers in these sectors should:</p>
<ul>
<li>practise&nbsp;<a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">physical (social) distancing</a>&nbsp;(maintain a distance of 2 metres from others)</li>
<li>closely&nbsp;<strong>self-monitor</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Should they exhibit any symptoms, they must isolate and contact their  local public health authority.</p>
<p>Employers in these sectors should:</p>
<ul>
<li>conduct active daily monitoring of their staff for COVID-19 symptoms (checking for cough, fever or shortness of breath)</li>
<li>use the&nbsp;<a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/guidance-documents/risk-informed-decision-making-workplaces-businesses-covid-19-pandemic.html">risk-informed decision-making guidelines for workplaces/businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="domestic">Travellers  within Canada</h2>
<p>As of March 30, 2020, all passengers flying in Canada will be subject to  a health check prior to boarding.</p>
<p>You will not be permitted to board if you:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>show any symptoms of COVID-19&nbsp;<strong>or</strong></li>
<li>have been refused boarding in the past 14 days due to a medical reason related to COVID-19&nbsp;<strong>or</strong></li>
<li>are subject to a provincial or local public health order</li>
</ul>

<p>This also applies to travellers arriving from&nbsp;<strong>outside Canada</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are arriving from outside Canada and are deemed safe to fly, you  may board a connecting flight to your destination. However, upon arrival at  your final destination, you must go directly to the place where you will  isolate, and remain there for 14 days. This is because you are still at risk of  developing symptoms and infecting others.</p>
<p>You may be subject to additional provincial or territorial public health  measures at your final destination.</p>
<p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you will&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>be  allowed to board any flight until:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 days have passed&nbsp;<strong>or</strong></li>
<li>you present a medical certificate confirming that your symptoms are not related to COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be  allowed to use public transportation to travel to the place where you will  isolate.</p>
<h2 id="_Travellers_departing_Canada">Travellers  departing Canada</h2>

<h3 id="non-essential">Avoid  all non-essential travel</h3>
<p>To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Government of Canada advises that  you&nbsp;<strong>avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada</strong>&nbsp;until  further notice.</p>
<p>Many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions, such as  movement restrictions and quarantines.</p>
<p>Many airlines are suspending flights. Many airports are closing, preventing flights from  leaving. Exit bans are becoming more frequent.</p>
<p>New restrictions may be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans  may be severely disrupted and you may be forced to remain outside of Canada  longer than expected. Canadian travellers should return to Canada as soon as  possible.</p>
<p>Making the choice to stay at home and not travel outside of Canada is  the best way to protect yourself, your family and the most vulnerable groups in  our communities from COVID-19. Contact your airline or tour operator to determine  options for cancelling or postponing your trip.</p>
<p>If you are still considering travel outside of Canada, you should do the  following:</p>
<ul>
<li>check the&nbsp;<a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/221">pandemic COVID-19 travel health notice</a>&nbsp;before travelling and know the health risks&nbsp;for your destination</li>
<li>understand the risks of your&nbsp;<a href="#s">safety and security abroad</a></li>
<li>ensure that you have sufficient finances and necessities, including medication, in case your travels are disrupted</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to remember that if you travel abroad, you could be  subject to the measures of other countries. Your 1-week trip may become much  longer. You may also have reduced access to quality health care.</p>
<h3 id="must-travel">If  you must travel during the pandemic</h3>

<p>Take&nbsp;<a href="https://canada-preview.adobecqms.net/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p">precautions against respiratory  illnesses</a>,  and seek medical attention if you become sick.</p>
<p>During your trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings">large crowds</a>&nbsp;or crowded areas</li>
<li>avoid contact with sick people, especially if they have a cough, fever or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>be aware of the local situation and follow local public health advice</li>
<li><a href="/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html">wash your hands</a> often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds
<ul>
	<li>use alcohol-based hand sanitizer  if soap and water are not available and always keep some with you when  you travel</li>
</ul></li>

<li>practise  proper <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene">cough  and sneeze etiquette</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mon">Monitor  your health </h3>

<p>If you become sick, avoid contact with others except to see a health  care professional.</p>
<p>If you feel sick during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, inform  the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer.</p>
<p>If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone who  was sick with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada border services  agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the&nbsp;<em>Quarantine Act</em>.  The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow.</p>
<p>You will see messaging on arrivals screens at international airports to  help guide you if you are experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Arriving travellers will also be provided with information on what  symptoms to identify and how to&nbsp;<a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">contact local health authorities</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cruise">Avoid all travel on  cruise ships </h3>

<p>The Government of Canada is&nbsp;<strong>advising that you avoid all travel  on cruise ships</strong>&nbsp;due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further  notice.</p>
<p>Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who may be  arriving from areas with known or unknown spread of COVID-19. The virus can  spread quickly on board cruises due to the close contact between passengers. Older  people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition  are at a higher risk of developing severe disease.</p>
<p>Recent cruise ship outbreaks of COVID-19 indicate that a large number of  individuals onboard can become infected. While the majority of affected  passengers may experience mild symptoms, there have been a&nbsp;<strong>significant</strong>&nbsp;number  of cases requiring hospitalization and&nbsp;<strong>critical care</strong>, and some  deaths have been reported.</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 situation evolves, many countries outside of Canada are  implementing policies and restrictions in order to contain the global outbreak.  These restrictions may impact a cruise traveller's:</p>
<ul>
<li>itinerary</li>
<li>ability to disembark</li>
<li>access to health care</li>
</ul>

<p>While abroad, if an outbreak of COVID-19 occurs on your cruise ship:</p>
<ul>
<li>you could be subject to quarantine procedures, onboard ship or in a foreign country</li>
<li>the range of consular services available to those on cruise ships, in particular in situations of quarantine, may be significantly restricted by local authorities</li>
<li>upon return to Canada, you will be required to remain in mandatory isolation for 14 days at a location determined by the Chief Public Health Officer as per the terms of any applicable&nbsp;<a href="/en/public-health/corporate/mandate/about-agency/acts-regulations/list-acts-regulations.html#qt">emergency orders</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Although it is not advised, Canadians who choose to voyage on a cruise  ship should also be aware that they: </p>
<ul>
<li>may  not be offered the opportunity to return to Canada on a government-organized  repatriation flight <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>could  be responsible for the costs of repatriation travel</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="immigrants">Immigrants, permanent residents and foreign workers</h2>
<p>There are special rules for immigrants, permanent residents, international students and temporary foreign workers:</p>
