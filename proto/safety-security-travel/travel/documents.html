	<h2 id="insurance">Travel insurance</h2>
	<p>If you are currently travelling outside Canada, we recommend that you consider returning to Canada as soon as possible. If you plan to travel outside Canada, travel insurance providers will no longer provide coverage for travel booked on or after March 13, 2020 when the <a href="/travelling/advisories">official global travel advisory</a> came into effect. This global advisory overrides other risk levels for all countries, including the United States, with the exception of areas for which we advise to avoid all travel (including regional advisories).</p>
<br/>
<p>If you are already outside Canada, including the United States, choosing to stay abroad could change or complicate your travel health insurance coverage, including losing coverage for COVID-19 and other conditions. Your travel insurance provider may only give you a 10-day notice before placing limits on your insurance policy. It is your responsibility to know and understand the terms of your insurance policy. Read the fine print carefully and ask for help, if you need it. Check with your travel insurance provider to know more about your policy related to COVID-19.</p>
