	<h2>Your safety and security outside Canada</h2>

	<p>The Government of Canada continues to advise all Canadians to&nbsp;<a href="/travelling/advisories"><b>avoid all non-essential travel outside Canada</b></a>.</p>
	<p>We are working with airlines and foreign governments to facilitate access to commercial flights for Canadians who wish to return home.</p>
	<p>Although we are doing all we can to support Canadians overseas, we recognize that many individuals may need to remain out of Canada for an indeterminate period.</p>
	<p><b>If you must travel or are already outside Canada:</b></p>
	<ul type="disc">
	<li>Find out what commercial options, if any, remain available and return to Canada as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Register with the&nbsp;<a href="/travelling/registration">Registration of Canadians Abroad</a>&nbsp;service. Make sure your contact information is complete and up to date. This will allow consular officials to contact you, provide updates and confirm your situation.</li>
	<li>Regularly check your destination’s&nbsp;<a href="/travelling/advisories">Travel Advice and Advisories</a>.</li>
	<li>Monitor local media to stay informed of the situation.</li>
	<li>Follow the advice of local authorities, including public health advice and lockdown or shelter-in-place guidance.</li>
	<li>Take precautions against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html">COVID-19</a>.

	<li>Make sure you have a local SIM card and charger for your mobile phone.</li>
	<li>Make sure your passport is valid for at least another six months.
