											hit by the pandemic, and protect the jobs Canadians depend on.</p>
										<p>The subsidy covers 75% of an employee's wages – up to $847 per week - for employers of all sizes
											and across all sectors who have suffered a drop in gross revenues of at least 15% in March, and
											30% in April and May.</p>
										<p>The program will be in place for a 12-week period, from March 15 to June 6, 2020.</p>
										<p>Employers eligible for the CEWS are entitled to receive a 100% refund for certain employer
											contributions to Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, and the
											Quebec Parental Insurance Plan paid in respect of employees who are on leave with pay.
											For employers that are eligible for both the CEWS and the 10% Temporary Wage Subsidy for a period,
											any benefit from the <a href="#temporary_10_wage_subsidy">Temporary 10% Wage Subsidy</a> for
											remuneration paid in a specific period will generally reduce the amount available to be claimed
