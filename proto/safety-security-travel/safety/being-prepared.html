	<h2 id="a1">Being prepared</h2>
	<p>COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily. The risk will vary between and  within communities. Some Canadians are <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/people-high-risk-for-severe-illness-covid-19.html">more at risk</a> of developing severe  complications from COVID-19 due to underlying medical conditions and age. </p>
	<p>Given the increasing number of  cases in Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered <strong>high</strong>. This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on our health care system. </p>
	<p>If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could affect health care resources for  Canadians.</p>
	<p>Our public health efforts will continue to focus on containment to delay the onset of community spread by:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>rapidly identifying cases</li>
	  <li>meticulously finding close contacts </li>
	  <li>using tried and true public health measures such as <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/self-monitoring-self-isolation-isolation-for-covid-19.html">isolation</a> and <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">physical (social) distancing</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>It takes more than actions from governments and the health sector to mitigate the impacts of  COVID-19, <strong>everyone has a role to play</strong>. </p>
	<p>Though it is normal for people  and communities to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried, remember that you are not alone. <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/taking-care-mental-health.html#help">Help is available</a> if you feel overwhelmed or need additional  support. Taking care of your mental and physical wellbeing is particularly important throughout this often unsettling situation.</p>
	<p>We can all help our country be prepared by: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>understanding <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#h">how coronavirus spreads</a></li>
	  <li>knowing <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p">how to prevent illness</a></li>
	  <li>taking care of our <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/taking-care-mental-health.html">mental and physical wellbeing</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="a2">For individuals</h2>
	<p>Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of any illness, especially respiratory infections.</p>
	<p>Now and always during cold and flu season, <strong>stay home if you are sick</strong>. Encourage those you know are sick to stay home until they no longer have symptoms.</p>
	<p>Since respiratory viruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are spread through contact, change how you greet one another. Instead of a handshake, a kiss or a hug, a friendly wave or elbow bump is less likely to expose you to respiratory viruses.</p>

	<p>Practise frequent <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene">hygiene</a>, which includes <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands.html">proper hand washing</a> and coughing and sneezing etiquette. Clean and <a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19.html">disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces</a>, such as toys and door handles.</p>

	<p>These are the most important ways that you can protect yourself and your family from respiratory illness, including COVID-19.</p>
	<details>

	  <summary id="make">Make a plan</summary>

	  <p>If COVID-19 becomes common in your community, you will want to have thought about how to change your behaviours and routines to reduce the risk of infection.</p>

	  <p>Your plan should include how you can change your regular habits to reduce your exposure to crowded places. For example, you may:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>do your grocery shopping at off-peak hours</li>
	    <li>commute by public transit outside of the busy rush hour</li>
	    <li>opt to exercise outdoors instead of in an indoor fitness class</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Your plan should also include what you will do if you become sick. If you are a caregiver of children or other dependents, you will want to have thought ahead to engage backup caregivers.</p>

	  <p>You should also think about what you will do if a member of your family becomes sick and needs care. Talk to your employer about working from home if you are needed to care for a family member at home.</p>

	  <p>If you become ill, <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/covid-19-how-to-isolate-at-home.html">stay home until you are no longer showing symptoms</a>. Employers should not require a sick leave note as that will put added pressure on limited health care services.</p>

	  <p>Your plan should include&nbsp;<a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/being-prepared.html#_Stock_up_on">shopping for supplies</a>&nbsp;that you should have on hand at all times. This will ensure you do not need to leave your home while you are sick or busy caring for an ill family member.</p>
	  <p>Your plan should build on the kits you have prepared for other potential emergencies. For more information on how to prepare yourself and your family in the event of an emergency, please visit <a href="https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/">GetPrepared.ca</a>.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary id="fill">Fill your prescriptions</summary>
	  <p>Refill your prescriptions now so that you do not have to go to a busy pharmacy if you do become sick. Consider seeing your health care provider to renew your prescriptions ahead of time.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary id="_Stock_up_on">Stock up on essentials but avoid panic buying</summary>
	  <p>At this time, it makes sense to fill your cupboards with non-perishable food items, so that you do not need to go shopping if you become sick.</p>
	  <p>It is easier on the supply chain if people gradually build up their household stores instead of making large-scale purchases all at once. To do this, you can add a few extra items to your grocery cart every time you shop. Good options are easy-to-prepare foods like:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>dried pasta and sauce</li>
	    <li>prepared canned soups</li>
	    <li>canned vegetables and beans</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>It is also a good idea to have extra stores of:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>pet food</li>
	    <li>toilet paper</li>
	    <li>facial tissue</li>
	    <li>feminine hygiene products</li>
	    <li>diapers (if you have children who use them)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>The reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self-isolate. Having these supplies on hand will ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary id="how">How to care for those who are ill</summary>
	  <p>If you or a member of your family become ill with COVID-19, there are <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/how-to-care-for-person-with-covid-19-at-home-advice-for-caregivers.html">precautions that should be taken in the home</a>. Your health care provider will advise you if hospital care is more appropriate. </p>
	  <p>Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/how-to-care-for-child-with-covid-19-at-home-advice-for-caregivers.html">advice for caregivers</a>. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.</p>
	  <p>To prepare for these potential situations, you should have on hand:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>soap</li>
	    <li>facial tissue</li>
	    <li>paper towels</li>
	    <li>alcohol-based hand sanitizer</li>
	    <li>household cleaning products</li>
	    <li>regular detergents for washing dishes and doing laundry</li>
	    <li>fever-reducing medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen
	      <ul>
	        <li>this includes products for children if you are a parent or caregiver</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>plastic garbage bags for containing soiled tissues and other waste</li>
	    <li>diluted bleach, prepared according to the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 1 teaspoon (5 mL) per cup (250 mL)
	      <ul>
	        <li>this assumes bleach is 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary id="get">Get reliable information</summary>
	  <p>Make sure that you get high-quality information about COVID-19 from reliable sources. The Public Health Agency of Canada is a reliable source of information, as are provincial and territorial public health authorities.</p>
	  <p>If you are finding that the news media is making you feel anxious, take a break from it.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary id="communicate">Communicate with family, friends and neighbours</summary>

	  <p>Let your family, friends and neighbours know that you are making plans to prepare for COVID-19. Share your plan with them, as this might motivate them to make their own.</p>

	  <p>Talk to them about a buddy system in which you agree to check in on each other and run essential errands if you become sick.</p>

	<p>Think about the type of care you would want if you became seriously ill, and talk to family, health care providers or others who would be making decisions about your care if you were not able to do so.  These discussions can help caregivers feel more comfortable and confident in making decisions aligned with your wishes. </p>

	<p>It’s not always easy; some need help to  begin these difficult conversations. Visit <a href="http://www.advancecareplanning.ca">advance care planning</a> for information, tools, and prompts to  help with starting these conversations. </p>

	<h2 id="a3">For communities</h2>
	<p><a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/social-distancing.html">Physical distancing</a> measures are a way to reduce COVID-19 transmission in the community by minimizing close contact with others, <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/people-high-risk-for-severe-illness-covid-19.html">especially people who are at high risk for severe illness during the peak of the outbreak.</a> </p>
	<p>Some of the physical distancing measures need extensive preparation. Community planners should prepare for: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>interruptions in social supports</li>
	  <li>reduction in public services like transit and access to community centres</li>
	  <li>financial consequences from the reduction of services or cancelled events</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Planners, administrators and employers must work together to put into effect community-based measures to protect:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>groups</li>
	  <li>employees</li>
	  <li>the general population </li>
	</ul>
	<details>
	  <summary>Avoiding crowds</summary>
	  <p>Respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 spread quickly in crowded spaces. Avoiding crowds can reduce the spread of infection. This type of precaution could have a significant impact on how a community functions. </p>
	  <p>Communities should plan ahead and consider:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>whether to shut down public transit
	      <ul>
	        <li>if public transit is shut down, ensure transportation remains available for:
	          <ul>
	            <li>critical infrastructure workers</li>
	            <li>emergency medical services or treatments like dialysis and chemotherapy</li>
	          </ul>
	        </li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>working with employers and businesses to put into effect staggered work hours
	      <ul>
	        <li>this reduces crowding on public transit during peak commuting hours and in large workplaces during normal workday hours</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>voluntary quarantine of a community based on a risk assessment</li>
	    <li>whether to ask individuals, organizations and businesses to cancel or postpone mass gatherings, such as:
	      <ul>
	        <li>funerals</li>
	        <li>weddings</li>

	        <li>concerts, conferences, sporting events and other forms of entertainment</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>requiring people to stay home from school, work or other community settings, such as shopping centres and movie theatres.</li>
	  </ul>
	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary>Mass gatherings</summary>
	  <p>Mass gatherings are settings or events where large numbers of people may be in close contact. If they are not planned and managed carefully, they can contribute to the transmission of respiratory pathogens, such as the virus that causes COVID-19. This can cause additional strain on the health care system during outbreaks.</p>
	  <p id="phacg">The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends that event organizers and planners cancel or postpone in-person gatherings in alignment with the recommendations of their local public health authorities. Where possible, they should offer virtual or online alternatives. </p>
	  <p>Aside from cancelling or postponing an event, other measures to reduce infection risks during mass gatherings include:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>avoiding shaking hands</li>
	    <li>practising <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene">proper hygiene</a></li>
	    <li>avoiding common sleeping areas</li>
	    <li>discouraging attendees from sharing food or drinks</li>
	    <li>increasing physical distance between others (ideally to <strong>2</strong> metres) by:
	      <ul>
	        <li>broadcasting events</li>
	        <li>offering virtual participation </li>
	        <li>moving the venue from indoors to outdoors</li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>eliminating self-serve buffet style eating at social or religious gatherings</li>
	    <li>encouraging ill people and <a href="/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/people-high-risk-for-severe-illness-covid-19.html">people who are at risk for severe illness</a> <strong>not</strong> to attend gatherings</li>
	    <li>supporting hand hygiene by providing hand sanitizers dispensers in prominent locations</li>
	    <li>ensuring event organizers have arrangements in place to safely isolate and transport people who become ill onsite</li>
	    <li>communicating clearly to attendees about the risks and directing them to our advice on reducing the spread of illness </li>
	  </ul>



	</details>
	<details>
	  <summary>Remote and isolated communities</summary>
	  <p>Communities that are remote or isolated should consider stocking up on needed supplies like food and medicine. The supply chain may be interrupted or become unreliable.</p>
	  <p>Additional challenges should be taken into account. For example, some remote communities may have limited access to clean running water for <a href="/en/public-health/services/healthy-living/hand-hygiene.html">frequent hand hygiene</a>.</p>

	</details>
	<h2 id="a4">For schools and daycares</h2>
	<p>To help reduce the transmission of COVID-19, there have been widespread school and daycare closures in Canada. These closures tend to have a high economic and social cost since they impact the many families that have one or both parents working outside of the home.</p>

	  <p>COVID-19 can create anxiety and be difficult for students and children to understand, especially if they know someone who is sick. </p>
	  <p>School and daycare communications should reflect the diverse linguistic, literacy, and cultural characteristics and needs of the students, children and their families. It may be necessary to monitor for discrimination and bullying surrounding COVID-19, in particular towards individuals or families who may have been exposed to the virus. They should pay attention to how students are feeling and consider the following:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>maintaining routine to reinforce a sense of security</li>
	    <li>providing reassurance about preventative health and safety measures </li>
	    <li>listening to students and encouraging them to communicate about their feelings</li>

	<p>Across Canada, we are changing the way we work to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For some workplaces, this may mean changing hours of operation, closing for a period of time or working from home.
