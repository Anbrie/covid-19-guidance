<h2>Buying insured mortgage pools for stability</h2>
<p>As a further proactive and coordinated  measure to bolster the financial system and the Canadian economy, the  government announced on March 16 that it is launching an Insured Mortgage  Purchase Program (IMPP). Under this program, the government will purchase up to $50 billion of insured mortgage pools through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).&nbsp;This action will provide long-term stable funding to banks and mortgage lenders, help facilitate continued lending to Canadian consumers and businesses, and add liquidity to Canada’s mortgage market. Details of the terms of the purchase operations will be provided to lenders by CMHC later this week. </p><p>
    The IMPP enhances the already substantial set  of measures announced on March 13 to support the economy and the financial  system. CMHC stands ready to further support liquidity and the stability of the  financial markets through its mortgage funding programs as necessary. </p><p>
    Further, the Bank of Canada has announced  that it will adjust its market liquidity operations to maintain market  functioning and credit availability during the current period of uncertainty in  which conditions are evolving rapidly. </p><p>
    The Bank of Canada also announced that it  will broaden eligible collateral for its term repo facility to include the full  range of collateral eligible under the Standing Liquidity Facility, with the  exception of the non-mortgage loan portfolio. This expansion of eligible  collateral will provide support to funding conditions for financial  institutions by providing a backstop to regular private funding. </p><p>
  The Bank also announced that it stands ready,  as a proactive measure, to provide support to the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB)  market so that this important funding market continues to function well. This  would include, as required, purchases of CMBs in the secondary market. Similar  to the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2020/03/expansion-bond-buyback-term-repo/">increase in Government of  Canada bond buybacks</a>, this will support market liquidity and price discovery. </p>
